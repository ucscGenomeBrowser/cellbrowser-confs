abstract = """Current smoking is associated with increased risk of severe
COVID-19, but it is not clear how cigarette smoke (CS) exposure affects
SARS-CoV-2 airway cell infection. We directly exposed air-liquid interface
(ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells
(ABSCs) to short term CS and then infected them with SARS-CoV-2. We found an
increase in the number of infected airway cells after CS exposure with a lack
of ABSC proliferation. Single-cell profiling of the cultures showed that the
normal interferon response was reduced after CS exposure with infection.
Treatment of CS-exposed ALI cultures with interferon Î²-1 abrogated the viral
infection, suggesting one potential mechanism for more severe viral infection.
Our data show that acute CS exposure allows for more severe airway epithelial
disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the innate immune response and ABSC
proliferation and has implications for disease spread and severity in people
exposed to CS.

<p>
Raw sequencing data were filtered by read quality, adaptor- and
polyA-trimmed, and reads were aligned to a hybrid human hg38-SARS Covid2
transcriptome using the Cell Range software (10X Genomics) and the STAR
aligner. Expression counts for each gene were collapsed and normalized to
unique molecular identifiers to construct a cell by gene matrix for each
library, filtered to keep cells with over 2000 transcripts and genes expressed
in at least 0.05% of cells.
<p>
Data analysis was performed in R. Expression matrices were normalized by the
total number of transcripts per cell in log space by dividing raw counts by the
total number of transcripts per cell, then multiplying by 10,000.
Two-dimensional visualization was obtained with the UMAP package. To identify
major cell types in our normal integrated datasets, previously published lung
epithelial cell type specific gene lists (Plasschaert et al., 2018) were used
to create cell type-specific gene signatures, with cells assigned by maximal
identity score.
