The intestine plays an important role in nutrient digestion and absorption,
microbe defense, and hormone secretion. Although major cell types have been
identified in the mouse intestinal epithelium, cell type-specific markers and
functional assignments are largely unavailable for human intestine. Here, our
single-cell RNA-seq analyses of 14,537 epithelial cells from human ileum,
colon, and rectum reveal different nutrient absorption preferences in the small
and large intestine, suggest the existence of Paneth-like cells in the large
intestine, and identify potential new marker genes for human
transient-amplifying cells and goblet cells. We have validated some of these
insights by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and functional analyses.
Furthermore, we show both common and differential features of the cellular
landscapes between the human and mouse ilea. Therefore, our data provide the
basis for detailed characterization of human intestine cell constitution and
functions, which would be helpful for a better understanding of human intestine
disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal tumorigenesis.

<section>Data normalization and batch correction</section>
<p>
Library size normalization was performed using Seurat NormalizeData.
Specifically, the global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize” normalized
the gene expression measurements for each cell by the total expression,
multiplied by a scaling factor (10,000 by default), and the results were
log-transformed. Next, the six batches of single-cell RNA-seq data were
subjected to batch correction, as described previously (Mayer et al., 2018). In
brief, the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) strategy was used to find
linear combinations of features across datasets that are maximally correlated.
The shared correlation structure conserved among the six datasets from the
ileum, colon, and rectum were identified. Based on the shared structure, all
six batches of data were finally pooled into a single object for downstream
analyses (Butler et al., 2018; Hardoon et al., 2004). Batch distributions for
each dataset were visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) plots.

<sectionUnsupervised clustering analysis</section>
<p>
The R package Seurat was used to combine linear and nonlinear dimensionality
reduction algorithms for unsupervised clustering of single cells. Specifically,
first, highly variable genes were identified by the FindVariableGenes function,
and average expression and dispersion for each gene were calculated.
Subsequently, CCA was performed based on the variable genes in the six
intestine samples. The canonical correlation vectors then projected each
dataset into the maximally correlated subspaces for downstream analysis.
Graph-based clustering was performed, which allocated cells in a K-nearest
neighbor graph structure based on high correlation strength CCA. The cells were
then iteratively clustered, and the modularity was optimized with the Louvain
algorithm. Finally, we used t-SNE to place cells with similar local
neighborhoods in high-dimensional space or low-dimensional space based on
scaled expression of variable genes to visualize the clustering results of all
the cells.
