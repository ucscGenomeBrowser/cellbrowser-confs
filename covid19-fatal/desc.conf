COVID-19 exhibits extensive patient-to-patient heterogeneity. To link immune
response variation to disease severity and outcome over time, we longitudinally
assessed circulating proteins as well as 188 surface protein markers,
transcriptome, and T cell receptor sequence simultaneously in single peripheral
immune cells from COVID-19 patients. Conditional-independence network analysis
revealed primary correlates of disease severity, including gene expression
signatures of apoptosis in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and attenuated
inflammation but increased fatty acid metabolism in CD56dimCD16hi NK cells
linked positively to circulating interleukin (IL)-15. CD8+ T cell activation
was apparent without signs of exhaustion. Although cellular inflammation was
depressed in severe patients early after hospitalization, it became elevated by
days 17–23 post symptom onset, suggestive of a late wave of inflammatory
responses. Furthermore, circulating protein trajectories at this time were
divergent between and predictive of recovery versus fatal outcomes. Our
findings stress the importance of timing in the analysis, clinical monitoring,
and therapeutic intervention of COVID-19.

# methods: please describe roughly what the samples are and how you processed them computationally
methods = """
<section>Single cell RNA sequencing</section>
PBMC samples were mixed with the reverse transcription (RT) mix and partitioned
into single cell Gel-Bead in Emulsion (GEM) using 10x 5′ Chromium Single Cell
Immune Profiling Next GEM v1.1 chemistry.

<section>UCSC Analysis</section>
<p>
At UCSC, cells were divided into "adaptive" and "innate" subsets based on celltypes in Fig 2B.
The gene expression matrix and metadata for each subset were separately run through
a generic scanpy pipeline to generate UMAP coordinates.
