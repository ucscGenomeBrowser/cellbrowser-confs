Recent advances in single cell genomics technologies have facilitated studies
on the developing immune system at unprecedented scale and resolution. However,
these studies have focused on one or a few organs and were thus limited in
understanding the developing immune system as a distributed network across
tissues. Here, we profiled prenatal haematopoietic organs, lymphoid organs and
non-lymphoid tissues using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, paired
antigen-receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reconstruct the
developing human immune system. Our analysis revealed the acquisition of immune
effector transcriptome profiles in macrophages, mast cells and NK cells from
the second trimester, and the transcriptomic changes accompanying the
late-stage maturation of developing monocytes and T cells that extended from
their organ of origin to peripheral tissues. We uncovered system-wide blood and
immune cell development beyond the conventional primary haematopoietic organs.
We further identified, extensively characterised and functionally validated the
human prenatal B1 cells. Finally, we provide evidence for thymocyte-thymocyte
selection origin for αβTCR- expressing unconventional T cells based on TCR gene
usage and an in vitro artificial thymic organoid culture model. Our
comprehensive atlas of the developing human immune system provides both
valuable data resources and biological insights that will facilitate cell
engineering, regenerative medicine and disease understanding.

<section>Tissue acquisition and processing</section>
<p>
All human developmental tissue samples used for this study were obtained from
the MRC– Wellcome Trust-funded Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR;
http://www.hdbr.org) with written consent and approval from the Newcastle and
North Tyneside NHS Health Authority Joint Ethics Committee (08/H0906/21+5).

<p>
All tissues were processed into single cell suspensions immediately upon
receipt. Tissue was first minced in a tissue culture dish using scalpel. It was
then digested with type IV collagenase (final concentration of 1.6 mg/ml;
Worthington) in RPMI (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Gibco), at 37°C for 30 min with intermittent agitation. Digested tissue
was then passed through a 100 µm cell strainer and cells were pelleted by
centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were then resuspended in 5 ml
red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience) and left for 5-10 min at room
temperature. It was then topped up with flow buffer (PBS containing 2% (v/v)
FBS and 2 mM EDTA) to 45 ml prior to cell counting and antibody staining.
Single cell suspensions were generated from 65 samples across yolk sac, liver,
bone marrow, spleen, thymus, kidney and skin of 21 donors. The ages of the
donors spanned from 4 pcw (post conception weeks) to 17 pcw.

<section>Single-cell RNA sequencing experiment</section>
<p>
Dissociated cells were stained with anti-CD45 antibody and DAPI prior to
sorting. Sorting by flow cytometry was performed with BD FACSAria Fusion Flow
Cytometer. CD45 positive fraction was sorted from DAPI−CD45+ gate, and CD45
negative fraction was sorted from DAPI− CD45− gate. CD45 gating was contiguous
so that no live cells were lost in sorting.

<p>
For scRNA-seq experiments, either Chromium single cell 3’ reagent kit or
Chromium single cell V(D)J kits from 10x Genomics were used. Unsorted, or
DAPI−CD45+ or DAPI−CD45− FACS- isolated cells were loaded onto each channel of
the Chromium chip following the manufacturer’s instructions before droplet
encapsulation on the Chromium controller. Single-cell cDNA synthesis,
amplification, gene expression (GEX) and targeted B cell receptor (BCR) and T
cell receptor (TCR) libraries were generated. Targeted enrichment for γδTCR was
done following the TCR enrichment protocol from 10x with customised primers
binding to the constant region of the TRD and TRG genes as described in Mimitou
et al. 2019. 

<p>
Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 system. The gene
expression libraries were sequenced at a target depth of 50,000 reads per cell
using the following parameters: Read1: 26 cycles, i7: 8 cycles, i5: 0 cycles;
Read2: 91 cycles to generate 75-bp paired-end reads. BCR and TCR libraries were
sequenced at a target depth of 5000 reads per cell.
