<section>Single-cell Preparation</section>
<p>
Wild-type C56Bl6, and Sox2-GFP mice were used for cell isolation from
mandibular incisors for single-cell transcriptomics experiments. Age of all
mice used for single-cell experiments was between 2 and 4 months. Mice were
sacrificed by isoflurane overdose. Mandibles were carefully dissected and under
stereomicroscope and surrounding soft tissue was removed. Using scalpel and
scissors mandibular bone was gradually removed to obtain separated incisor.
Particularly careful handling was performed in the soft area around the most
proximal part of incisor where cervical loops. </p>

<section>Analysis</section>
<p>
The reads were aligned to the UCSC mm10 genome assembly, and per-gene read
counts in each cell were determined using feature Counts software. STAR aligner
was used to align scRNA-seq reads. The cells were filtered to exclude those
with fewer than 800 detected genes resulting in 2889 out of 3312 cells for
further analysis. Only genes that had at least 60 reads in at least 30 cells
were considered for downstream processing. The data were analysed using PAGODA
using k-nearest neighbour error models (k = 20 and plain batch correction
across samples). Gene expression levels were normalized per mean expression
level in every cell and log10 transformed (abbreviated below as fpm). Annotated
Gene Ontology (GO) categories and de-novo gene clusters showing statistically
significant overdispersion (z-score > 2.3) were clustered to determine the top
aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity. Mitotic signature was removed from
gene expression values by regressing out the mitotic expression signature, as
previously described using a set of cell-cycle-related genes from6,31. The
cells were grouped in 17 clusters using unbiased clustering as determined by
PAGODA. t-SNE embedding was generated using Rtsne package and PAGODA-based
cell–cell distance with perplexity = 25. Expression of a set of genes, where it
is shown, was defined as their average expression for each cell.</p>
