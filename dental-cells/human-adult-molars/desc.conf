<p>
Tissue from adult human healthy molar pulp, adult human molar pulp with caries
and apical papilla from growing human molar was harvested for isolation of
cells for RNA-seq analysis. Adult human healthy molar and adult human molar
with caries were sectioned carefully to avoid damaging pulp using dental drill
through enamel and part of dentin in mesial-distal direction. Dental pulps from
adult molar and dental papilla were harvested, sectioned on petri dish in
droplet of HBSS (Sigma–Aldrich, H6648) on ice into small pieces and further
processed in the same way as mouse tissue.</p>

<section>Analysis</section>
<p>
Two growing apical papilla and five adult molar 10× Chromium datasets of human
teeth, comprising totally 41673 cells, were analysed using single-cell
variational inference (scVI) deep learning framework54. Gene space was
subsampled to 3000 genes using scVI subsample_genes routine following by
setting up parameters of variational autoencoder using VAE() routine with
parameters (n_hidden = 128, n_latent = 30, n_layers = 2 and
dispersion = ’gene’) and training it using UnsupervisedTrainer() routine with
n_epochs = 150. Batch effect correction was by default performed using
harmonization approach55. The resulting 30-dimensional reduced scVI space was
used to make 2d embedding of the datasets using UMAP() routine with parameter
spread = 1. K-nearest neighbour cell graph (k = 30) was constructed using
cosine-based cell–cell distances estimated in scVI space and then used to make
leiden clustering (resolution = 1).</p>
