Reconstruction and engineering of human teeth are the tasks of utmost
importance. Here we introduce detailed cellular atlas of the growing and
non-growing mouse and human teeth including a condition with caries, which will
enhance the field of dental engineering and lead to a better understanding of
stem cell niche dynamics enabling tooth growth. We report previously
unappreciated cellular complexity of the mouse incisor, including new
spatially-restricted stem, progenitor and differentiated populations and
compare this model system with the human adult, growing and caries-lesioned
teeth. This comparison revealed specific parallelisms in mechanisms of dental
growth in humans and mice. Beyond the main mesenchymal and epithelial
compartments, we demonstrate a surprising role of the immune system as a
mediator of the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions required for proper
development. Finally, our results brought new insights into the differentiation
of cell lineages producing enamel and dentin, which should be of utmost
importance for dental reconstructive engineering.
