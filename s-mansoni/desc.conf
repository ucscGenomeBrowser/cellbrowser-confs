Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that infects 240 million
people. With no vaccines and only one drug available, new therapeutic targets
are needed. The causative agents, schistosomes, are intravascular flatworm
parasites that feed on blood and lay eggs, resulting in pathology. The function
of the parasite’s various tissues in successful parasitism are poorly
understood, hindering identification of therapeutic targets. Using single-cell
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we characterize 43,642 cells from the adult
schistosome and identify 68 distinct cell populations, including specialized
stem cells that maintain the parasite’s blood-digesting gut. These stem cells
express the gene hnf4, which is required for gut maintenance, blood feeding,
and pathology in vivo. Together, these data provide molecular insights into the
organ systems of this important pathogen and identify potential therapeutic
targets.

<p>
Adult S. mansoni (NMRI strain, 6–7 weeks post-infection) were obtained from infected female
mice by hepatic portal vein perfusion with 37°C DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) plus 10%
Serum (either Fetal Calf Serum or Horse Serum) and heparin. Parasites were cultured as previously
described (5). Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed with male parasites.
Experiments with and care of vertebrate animals were performed in accordance with protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of UT Southwestern
Medical Center (approval APN: 2017-102092).

<section>Single-cell RNA sequencing</section>
<p>
FACS-sorted cells were centrifuged again at 500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C then resuspended in 0.2%
BSA in PBS. Libraries were created using a Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) according to
manufacturer guidelines and sequenced in using a NextSeq 500 (illumina). Sequencing data was
processed and mapped to the Schistosoma mansoni genome (v7) using Cell Ranger
(10x Genomics). Unfiltered data from Cell Ranger was imported into Seurat (v3.1.1)(25, 26)
and cells were filtered as follows: Female (nFeature_RNA (> 750), nCount_RNA
(1500-20000), Percent Mitochondrial (&lt;3&#37;); Male/Virgin female (nFeature_RNA (> 750),
nCount_RNA (1000-20000), Percent Mitochondrial (&lt;3&#37;)). Mitochondrial genes were
identified as those with the prefix “Smp_9”. Each of the 9 individual datasets (Table S5)
was normalized (NormalizeData) and
variable features were identified (FindVariableFeatures, selection.method = &quot;vst&quot;, nfeatures =
2000). From here, integration anchors were identified (FindIntegrationAnchors, dims 1:78), the
data was integrated (IntegrateData, dims = 1:78, features.to.integrate = features), and scaled
(ScaleData). We then ran RunPCA, RunUMAP (reduction = &quot;pca&quot;, dims = 1:78, n.neighbors =
40), FindNeighbors (reduction = &quot;pca&quot;, dims = 1:78), FindClusters (resolution = 5). The number
of principal components (78) used for this analysis was defined by JackStraw. Analysis of the
resulting single cell map found that clusters 27 and 50 contained few enriched markers, therefore
we removed the 964 cells present in these clusters and reran the analysis with 78 principal
components. From here we generated the final UMAP projection plot with RunUMAP
(n.neighbors = 36, min.dist = 0.70, dims = 1:80). Next, we generated clusters (FindClusters,
resolution = 5) and manually inspected the unique genes expressed in each of the clusters. In some
cases we found that some of the 85 resulting clusters did not express a core set of unique genes,
therefore, these clusters were merged into a single cluster of cells as follows: Neoblasts (clusters
0,1,2,6,7,37), Neoblast progeny (cluster 4,8), Neuron 1 (clusters 10, 60, 68), Neuron 6 (clusters
24, 26), Parenchyma (clusters 11, 12, 51), flame cells (clusters 14, 41), S1 Cells (clusters 3, 9, 32,
42) and tegument (clusters 36, 63). After merging we were left with a final map of 68 clusters of
43,642 cells. In some cases, we noted large differences or unexpected similarities in several cell
populations between which we reasoned could be attributable to technical factors (i.e. male
dissociation takes longer than female dissociation) which could disproportionately affect some cell
types in male parasites vs. female parasites (i.e. more muscle cells were recovered from female
parasites than from males, despite male parasites possessing more muscle cells per animal). In
order to confirm our clustering results and also to ensure that other factors such as differences in
read depth did not impact our analysis, we collapsed major cluster types (neurons, neoblasts, etc.)
and reanalyzed our data using the sctransform (that uses a negative binomial normalization rather
than log transformation used in our initial analysis) function from Seurat v3.1(27) (Fig. S18).
Briefly, we ran SCTransform on all nine of our samples individually with default setting. Next we
ran SelectIntegrationFeatures on all nine of our samples (nfeatures = 3000) to create a list of
integration features (“sct features”). We then ran PrepSCTIntegration on all nine of our samples
(anchor.features = “sct features”) using default settings. After this we ran FindIntegrationAnchors
on all nine of our samples (normalization.method = “SCT”, anchor.features = “sct features”) using
the default settings to generate our integration anchors (“integration anchors”). We then ran
IntegrateData (anchorset = “integration anchors”, normalization.method = “SCT”) with default
settings. Next we ran RunPCA on the dataset (npcs = 200). Finally, we ran RunUMAP
(n.neighbors = 50, min.dist = 0.20, dims = 1:200) and verified that our between-sample and
between sex clustering results were largely the same. We still observed fewer than anticipated
muscle cells in male samples, which we attribute to the relatively harsher dissociation conditions
experienced by male parasites. Similar biases in cell recovery have been described in the
dissociation of related flatworms (1).
