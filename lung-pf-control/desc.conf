<p>
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a form of chronic lung disease characterized by
progressive destruction of normal alveolar gas-exchange surfaces and
accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). In order to comprehensively define
the cell types, mechanisms and mediators driving ECM deposition and fibrotic
remodeling in lungs with pulmonary fibrosis, we performed single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of single-cell suspensions generated from
non-fibrotic control and PF lungs. Analysis of over 114,000 cells from 20 PF
and 10 control lungs identified 31 distinct cell types. We identified multiple
distinct lineages directly contribute to ECM expansion, including a novel
HAS1hi fibroblast subtype and a previously undescribed KRT5-/KRT17+, collagen
and ECM-producing epithelial cell population that was highly enriched in PF
lungs. Together these data provide high-resolution insights into the basic
mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis, and indicate a direct profibrotic role of the
lung epithelium in PF pathogenesis.
