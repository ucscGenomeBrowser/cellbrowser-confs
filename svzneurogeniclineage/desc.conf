The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is home to the largest neurogenic
niche in the adult mouse brain. Previous work has demonstrated that resident
stem cells in different locations within the V-SVZ produce different subtypes
of new neurons for the olfactory bulb. While great progress has been made in
understanding the differences in regional stem cell potential using viral and
genetic lineage tracing strategies, the core molecular heterogeneity that
underlies these regional differences is largely unknown. Here we present single
whole-cell and single nucleus sequencing datasets of microdissected adult mouse
V-SVZ, and evidence for the existence of two broad populations of adult neural
stem cells. By using spatially resolved microdissections in the single nucleus
sequencing dataset as a reference, and mapping marker gene expression in the
V-SVZ, we find that these two populations reside in largely non-overlapping
domains in either the dorsal or ventral V-SVZ. Furthermore, we identified two
subpopulations of newly born neurons that have gene expression consistent with
dorsal or ventral origins. Finally, we identify genes expressed by both stem
cells and the neurons they generate that specifically mark either the dorsal or
ventral adult neurogenic lineage. These datasets, methods and findings will
facilitate the study of region-specific regulation of adult neurogenesis.

<b>scRNA-Seq</b>: The V-SVZ was microdissected from male and female hGFAP:GFP mice.
Two male samples and two female samples were triturated into a single cell
suspension after papain digestion, and samples were individually barcoded with
MULTISeq barcodes. The samples were combined together, and cells were loaded
into a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller in duplicate. Seurat 3 was used to
analyze the data: cells with multiple barcodes were eliminated from analysis,
data was normalized using SCTransform, and technical replicates were combined
with IntegrateData and plotted in UMAP space. See Methods in the preprint for
further experimental details.

<b>sNucRNA-Seq</b>: Anterior-Ventral (AV), Anterior-Dorsal (AD), Posterior-Ventral
(PV) and Posterior-Dorsal (PD) regions were microdissected from 17 male and
female CD1 mice. Nuclei from each sample were isolated using a tissue douncer
and ultracentrifugation. Seurat 3 was used to analyze the data: data was
normalized using SCTransform, and AV, AD, PV and PD samples were combined with
IntegrateData and plotted in UMAP space.
