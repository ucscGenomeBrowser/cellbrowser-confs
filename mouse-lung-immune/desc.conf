At birth, the lungs rapidly transition from a pathogen-free, hypoxic
environment to a pathogen-rich, rhythmically distended air-liquid interface.
Although many studies have focused on the adult lung, the perinatal lung
remains unexplored. Here, we present an atlas of the murine lung immune
compartment during early postnatal development. We show that the late embryonic
lung is dominated by specialized proliferative macrophages with a surprising
physical interaction with the developing vasculature. These macrophages
disappear after birth and are replaced by a dynamic mixture of macrophage
subtypes, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes. Detailed
characterization of macrophage diversity revealed an orchestration of distinct
subpopulations across postnatal development to fill context-specific functions
in tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and immunity. These data both broaden the
putative roles for immune cells in the developing lung and provide a framework
for understanding how external insults alter immune cell phenotype during a
period of rapid lung growth and heightened vulnerability.

<section>Analysis</section>
<p>
Sequencing reads were mapped against the mouse genome (GRCm38) using STAR
aligner (Dobin et al., 2013) and gene were counted using HTSeq (Anders et al.,
2015). FZ has been the main maintainer of HTSeq for several years. To
coordinate mapping and counting on Stanfordâ€™s high-performance computing
cluster, snakemake was used (Koster and Rahmann, 2012). Gene expression count
tables were converted into loom objects (https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/) and
cells with less than 50,000 uniquely mapped reads or less than 400 genes per
cell were discarded. Of the 4199 immune cells that were filtered, an additional
147 were removed as suspected doublets. Doublets were removed in two ways.
First, clusters that expressed epithelial, endothelial or mesenchymal genes
were excluded. Clusters showing joint expression of mutually exclusive cell
type markers (e.g. Epcam, Cdh5, Col6a2) with Cd45 were manually excluded as
well. Counts for the remaining 4052 cells were normalized to counts per million
reads. For t-distributed stochastic embedding (t-SNE) (van der Maaten and
Hinton, 2008), 500 features were selected that had a high Fano factor in most
mice, and the restricted count matrix was log-transformed with a pseudocount of
0.1 and projected onto the top 25 principal components using scikit-learn
(Pedregosa et al., 2011).
