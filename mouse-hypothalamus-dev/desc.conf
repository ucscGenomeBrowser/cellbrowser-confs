A wealth of specialized neuroendocrine command systems intercalated within the
hypothalamus control the most fundamental physiological needs in
vertebrates. Nevertheless, we lack a developmental blueprint that integrates
the molecular determinants of neuronal and glial diversity along temporal and
spatial scales of hypothalamus development. Here we combine single-cell RNA
sequencing of 51,199 mouse cells of ectodermal origin, gene regulatory network
(GRN) screens in conjunction with genome-wide association study-based disease
phenotyping, and genetic lineage reconstruction to show that nine glial and
thirty-three neuronal subtypes are generated by mid-gestation under the control
of distinct GRNs. Combinatorial molecular codes that arise from
neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and transcription factors are minimally
required to decode the taxonomical hierarchy of hypothalamic neurons. The
differentiation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and dopamine neurons, but not
glutamate neurons, relies on quasi-stable intermediate states, with a pool of
GABA progenitors giving rise to dopamine cells. We found an unexpected
abundance of chemotropic proliferation and guidance cues that are commonly
implicated in dorsal (cortical) patterning in the hypothalamus. In particular,
loss of SLIT–ROBO signalling impaired both the production and positioning of
periventricular dopamine neurons. Overall, we identify molecular principles
that shape the developmental architecture of the hypothalamus and show how
neuronal heterogeneity is transformed into a multimodal neural unit to provide
virtually infinite adaptive potential throughout life.
