<section>Single-cell ATAC-seq peak calling</section>
<p>
For scATAC-seq peak calling from clusters or manually defined cell types, all
single cells belonging to the given group were pooled together. These pooled
fragment files were converted to the paired-end tagAlign format and processed
with version 1.4.2 of the ENCODE DCC ATAC-seq pipeline. The conversion to
tagAlign was performed as follows. For fragments on the positive strand, the
read start coordinate was the fragment start coordinate, zero-indexed. The read
end coordinate was the fragment start coordinate plus the read length (99 bp).
For fragments on the negative strand, the read start coordinate was the
fragment end coordinate, zero-indexed. The read start coordinate was the
fragment end coordinate minus the read length (99 bp). Then, these tagAlign
files were used as input to the DCC ATAC-seq pipeline. IDR optimal peak sets
with an IDR threshold of 0.05 were determined for each cluster by the pipeline,
using pseudo-bulk replicate tagAligns for the cluster. Other pipeline
parameters were the same as for bulk ATAC-seq data (see above).
