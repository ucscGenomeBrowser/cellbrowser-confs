methods = "<h5><b>Mice</b></h5><p>Pregnant females were identified by echocardiography performed at E6.5 and sacrificed to harvest embryos at E7.75, E8.25 and E9.25. Transcriptomes from at least 2 embryos were collected per embryonic stage, per genotype. Embryos were developmentally matched at each time point by somite count (4, 8, and 21 somites from E7.75, E8.25, and E9.25, respectively).</p><h5><b>Embryo dissection and single-cell library generation</b></h5>The entire cardiogenic region was dissected at each time point, including the SHF region that lies behind the cardiac crescent and heart tube, as well as the first and second pharyngeal arches at E9.25. Due to the small size of embryos at these stages, some surrounding tissue (indicated in Figure 1a) encompassing the posterior lateral plate mesoderm (E7.75), head folds (E7.75 and E8.25), and endoderm, was microdissected to ensure complete retrieval of cardiac populations. Embryos were dissected in cold PBS (Life Technologies, CAT# 14190250), de-yolked and placed in PBS/1% FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific, CAT# 10439016) solution on ice until dissociation (approximately 3 hours). Yolk sac DNA was extracted (QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution, Epicentre, CAT# QE09050) and used for genotyping to distinguish Hand2 WT and Hand2-null embryos before further microdissection of cardiac regions at each stage. Dissected cardiac tissue was incubated in 200 μl TrypLE (ThermoFisher Scientific, CAT# 12563029) for 5 min, triturated with a 200 μl pipette tip, and incubated for an additional 5 min. The TrypLE solution was quenched with 600 μl PBS/1% FBS. Cells were filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon, CAT# 08-771-2), centrifuged at 150 rcf for 3 min, and resuspended in 35 μl PBS/1% FBS. Single-cell droplet libraries from this suspension were generated in the Chromium WTler according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v2 User Guide. Additional components used for library preparation include the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 (PN-120237) and the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Chip kit v2 (PN-120236).<h5><b>Single-cell transcriptome library preparation and sequencing</b></h5><p>Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v2 (PN- 120237) and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (PN-120262). Final libraries were sequenced on the NextSeq 500 and Hiseq 4000. Somite-matched WT and Hand2-null replicate libraries from each litter were pooled and sequenced in the same lane. Sequencing parameters were selected according to the Chromium Single Cell v2 specifications. All libraries were sequenced to a mean read depth of at least 50,000 total aligned reads per cell.</p><h5><b>Processing of raw sequencing reads</b></h5><p>Raw sequencing reads were processed using the Cell Ranger v2.0 pipeline from 10X Genomics. Briefly, reads were demultiplexed, aligned to the mouse mm10 genome and UMI counts were quantified per gene per cell to generate a gene-barcode matrix. Data from multiple samples (WT only analysis, WT/Hand2-null E7.75/E8.25 and WT/Hand2-null E9.25 analyses) were aggregated and normalized to the same sequencing depth, resulting in a combined gene-barcode matrix of all samples.</p><h5><b>Cell filtering and cell-type clustering analysis</b></h5><p>We sequenced the transcriptomes of 36, 777 cells captured from WT and 37,149 cells captured from Hand2-null embryos in total. Further filtering and clustering analyses of these cells were performed with the Seurat v2.2 R package, as described in the tutorials (http://satijalab.org/seurat/). For each aggregated dataset (WT only, WT/Hand2-null E7.75/E8.25, WT/Hand2-null E9.25), cells were normalized for genes expressed per cell and total expression, then multiplied by a scale factor of 10,000 and log-transformed. Cells that had a disproportionately large number of UMIs relative to the number of genes were treated as multiplets and filtered out of the analysis. We then performed a regression to eliminate technical variability due to the number of genes detected, embryonic time point, embryo replicate and stage of the cell cycle. For the Hand2-null analyses, we also regressed out the Hand2 gene to eliminate its contribution to cell clustering. Highly variable genes in the dataset were computed and used as input for Principal Component Analysis. Significant PCs were used for downstream graph-based, semi-unsupervised clustering into distinct populations (FindClusters Function) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction was used to project these populations in 2D. For clustering, the resolution parameter, which indirectly controls the number of clusters, was approximated based on the number of cells according to Seurat guidelines; a vector of resolution parameters was passed to the FindClusters function and the optimal resolution that established discernible clusters with distinct marker gene expression was selected. To identify marker genes, the clusters were compared pairwise for differential gene expression using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for single-cell gene expression (FindAllMarkers function, min.pct = 0.25, min.diff.pct = 0.1, return.thresh (p-value cut-off) = 1x10-4). We removed blood, endoderm-, and ectoderm- derived clusters based on their expression of known blood markers such as the hemoglobin genes, endoderm markers such as Epcam and Foxa2, and ectoderm markers such as Pou3f1 and Sox2 (Extended Data Fig.1), retaining the cells of mesodermal or neural crest identity. The clustering approach was then repeated for these retained mesodermal and neural crest cells, beginning with the regression of technical variables, identification of highly variable genes, Principal Component Analysis, graph-based clustering, UMAP projection and marker analysis. Similarly, the reclustering analyses (i.e., endocardium/endothelium, myocardium, multipotent progenitors from Fig.1 and the AHF/pSHF reclustering discussed in Fig. 2) were processed as described above. For computing differentially expressed genes in the Hand2-null analysis, the FindMarkers function was used on WT and Hand2-null cells from each cluster with the following parameters: Wilcoxon rank sum test, min.diff.pct = 0.1, min.pct = 0.25, logFC.threshold = 0.2. Additionally, the max.cells.per.ident argument was used to ensure that equivalent numbers of cells were considered in the analysis. For each population analyzed, the value of cells given to this argument was set to the genotype that had the lower cell number. An adjusted p-value (Bonferroni Correction) cut-off < 1x10-4 was used to identify differentially expressed genes.</p>"
