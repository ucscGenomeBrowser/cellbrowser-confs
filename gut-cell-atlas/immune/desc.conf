<section>Colon and MLN tissue retrieval</section>
<p>
Human tissue was obtained from deceased transplant organ donors after
ethical approval (reference 15/EE/0152, East of England—Cambridge South
Research Ethics Committee) and informed consent from the donor families.
Fresh mucosal tissue from the cecum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon,
and lymph nodes from the intestinal mesentery, were excised within 60 min
of circulatory arrest; colon tissue was preserved in University of
Wisconsin organ-preservation solution (Belzer UW Cold Storage Solution;
Bridge to Life) and MLNs were stored in saline at 4 °C until processing.
Tissue dissociation was conducted within 2 h of tissue retrieval. Four
individuals (287c, 296b, 403c and 411c) had received antibiotics in the
two weeks before death (Supplementary Table 1).

<section>10x Genomics Chromium GEX library preparation and sequencing</section>
<p>
Cells were loaded according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the
Chromium Single Cell 3′ Kit v.2 or 5′ gene expression v.2 to attain
between 2,000 and 5,000 cells per well. Library preparation was carried
out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the samples from donors
290b, 298c and 302c, eight 10x Genomics Chromium 3′ libraries were pooled
and sequenced on 8 lanes of an Illumina Hiseq 4000. For the samples from
donors 390c and 417c, 16 10x Genomics Chromium 5′ libraries were pooled
and sequenced on 2 lanes of a S2 flow cell of an Illumina NovaSeq 6000
with 50 base pairs paired-end reads.

<section>Cell-type annotation</section>
<p>
Cells were clustered using the Scanpy v.1.4 processing pipeline43.
Briefly, counts were normalized to 10,000 reads per cell
(sc.pp.normalise_per_cell) and log-transformed (sc.pp.log1p) to be
comparable among cells. The number of unique molecular identifiers and
percentage of mitochondrial genes were regressed out (sc.pp.regress_out)
and genes were scaled (sc.pp.scale) to unit variance. Normalized counts
were used to detect highly variable genes (sc.pp.highly_variable_genes).
Batch correction between donors was performed using bbknn v.1.3.6 (ref.
44) on 50 principal components and the trim parameter set to 100. Clusters
were then identified using Leiden graph-based clustering (resolution set
to 1).
