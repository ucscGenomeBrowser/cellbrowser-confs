<section>Fetal Tissue Sampling</section>
<p>
First trimester human fetal tissue was collected from patients undergoing
elective termination of pregnancy. Patients gave informed consent as part of
the ethically approved research study (REC-96/085). Fetal age (post conception
weeks, PCW) was estimated using the independent measurement of the crown rump
length (CRL), using the formula PCW (days) = 0.9022 × CRL (mm) + 27.372. Fetal
sample ages in post-conception weeks were as follows: BRC2029 - 6.1, BRC2026 -
8.4, BRC2043 - 10.2, BRC2046 - 6.7, BRC2049- 6.9, BRC2121 - 9.2, BRC2119- 7.9,
BRC2133 - 9.9, BRC2134- 10. Organoids were derived from fetal tissues BRC2038-
6.4, BRC2039 - 5.4, BRC2206- 6.5.

<section>Single-cell RNA-sequencing</section>
<p>
Single-cell suspension for each primary intestinal or organoid sample was
loaded onto a separate channel of a Chromium 10x Genomics single cell 3’v2
library chip as per manufacturer's protocol (10x Genomics; PN-120233), aiming
for a cell capture recovery of 3000-5000 cells. cDNA sequencing libraries were
prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced on an Illumina
Hi-seq 4000 (2x50bp paired-end reads).

<section>UCSC Analysis</section>
<p>
At UCSC, the raw UMI count matrix and metadata were feed into a generic scanpy pipeline to
generate UMAP and tSNE coordinates. It was assumed that the cells in the count matrix had
already been filtered for quality, so cell-filtering steps were skipped.
