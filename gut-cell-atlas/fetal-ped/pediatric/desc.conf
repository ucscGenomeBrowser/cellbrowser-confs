<section>Pediatric Tissue Sampling</section>
<p>
Human intestinal mucosal biopsies were obtained from patients undergoing
colonoscopy at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK. All patients gave
informed consent for extra biopsy samples to be taken for research use
when undergoing elective colonoscopy (REC 17/EE/0265). Patients were then
included if, after macroscopic visualization and histological analysis,
they were diagnosed as either having CD, or being without an inflammatory
diagnosis (control). Patient ages were as follows: Control group (T036- 4
years, T110- 4 years, T161- 4 years, T057- 6 years, T182- 9 years, T44- 10
years, T024- 12 years, T160- 10 years); CD group (T197- 9 years, T176- 11
years, T019- 12 years, T202- 12 years, T017-13 years, T189-13 years,
T203-14 years).

<section>Single-cell RNA-sequencing</section>
<p>
Single-cell suspension for each primary intestinal or organoid sample was
loaded onto a separate channel of a Chromium 10x Genomics single cell 3’v2
library chip as per manufacturer's protocol (10x Genomics; PN-120233), aiming
for a cell capture recovery of 3000-5000 cells. cDNA sequencing libraries were
prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced on an Illumina
Hi-seq 4000 (2x50bp paired-end reads).

<section>UCSC Analysis</section>
<p>
At UCSC, the raw UMI count matrix and metadata were feed into a generic scanpy pipeline to
generate UMAP and tSNE coordinates. It was assumed that the cells in the count matrix had
already been filtered for quality, so cell-filtering steps were skipped.
