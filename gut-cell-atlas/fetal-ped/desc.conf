Human gut development requires the orchestrated interaction of differentiating
cell types. Here, we generate an in-depth single-cell map of the developing
human intestine at 6–10 weeks post-conception. Our analysis reveals the
transcriptional profile of cycling epithelial precursor cells; distinct from
LGR5-expressing cells. We propose that these cells may contribute to
differentiated cell subsets via the generation of LGR5-expressing stem cells
and receive signals from surrounding mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, we draw
parallels between the transcriptomes of ex vivo tissues and in vitro fetal
organoids, revealing the maturation of organoid cultures in a dish. Lastly, we
compare scRNA-seq profiles from pediatric Crohn’s disease epithelium alongside
matched healthy controls to reveal disease-associated changes in the epithelial
composition. Contrasting these with the fetal profiles reveals the
re-activation of fetal transcription factors in Crohn’s disease.
