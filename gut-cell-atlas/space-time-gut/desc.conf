The cellular landscape of the human intestinal tract is dynamic throughout
life, developing in utero and changing in response to functional requirements
and environmental exposures. Here, to comprehensively map cell lineages, we use
single-cell RNA sequencing and antigen receptor analysis of almost half a
million cells from up to 5 anatomical regions in the developing and up to 11
distinct anatomical regions in the healthy paediatric and adult human gut. This
reveals the existence of transcriptionally distinct BEST4 epithelial cells
throughout the human intestinal tract. Furthermore, we implicate IgG sensing as
a function of intestinal tuft cells. We describe neural cell populations in the
developing enteric nervous system, and predict cell-type-specific expression of
genes associated with Hirschsprungâ€™s disease. Finally, using a systems
approach, we identify key cell players that drive the formation of secondary
lymphoid tissue in early human development. We show that these programs are
adopted in inflammatory bowel disease to recruit and retain immune cells at the
site of inflammation. This catalogue of intestinal cells will provide new
insights into cellular programs in development, homeostasis and disease.
