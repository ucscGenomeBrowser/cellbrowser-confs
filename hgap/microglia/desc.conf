Seurat object of 30,478 microglia derived from human cortex (middle
frontal gyrus) and hippocampus.

# methods: please describe roughly what the samples are and how you processed them computationally
methods = """
Cryopreserved human specimens, five cortex (middle frontal gyrus) and four
hippocampus from nine cognitively normal individuals ranging in age from
37-73 years. Nuclei were isolated using nuclear isolation buffer and
dounce homogenization. Nuclei were immunolabeled using NeuN antibody and
the non-neuronal, or glial, cell population was isolated using
fluorescence-activated flow sorting (FACS) for the NeuN-negative
population. The single-cell combinatorial indexed assay for transposase
accessible chromatin using sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) was performed on all
samples to generate a dataset of 378,270 cells with a total of 779,149
open chromatin regions. Dimensionality reduction of regional counts
matrices (cortex and hippocampus) and assessment of canonical glial cell
type markers revealed distinct clusters for all expected gross glial cell
types: oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, astrocytes, and
microglia. 

The microglia-specific dataset, presented here, was generated using Seurat
V3. To allow for inter-individual assessment of glial cell type
heterogeneity, we corrected for individual-based batch effect by
projecting cells from each individual into shared embeddings using
Harmony. Dimensionality reduction and Louvain clustering revealed six
microglia sub-clusters. Downstream processing includes generation of gene
activity matrices from cis-co-accessibility networks and transcription
factor motif enrichment analysis."
