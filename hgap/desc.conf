The human central nervous system is a complex tissue comprising
neuronal and non-neuronal cell types that orchestrate cognition.
Single-cell characterization of neurons has revealed cellular
sub-types that have diverse functions; however, non-neuronal cells
have not been characterized to the same resolution. This discrepancy
in our understanding of neuronal and glial molecular diversity is an
obstacle to creating a complete map of cell state heterogeneity, and
therefore function, in the human brain. In this study, we focused on
the cortex and hippocampus of the human brain in nine cognitively
healthy adults. We assessed the cellular diversity of glia using the
single-cell chromatin accessibility assay sci-ATAC-seq to
epigenetically characterize 378,270 cells using 779,149 open
chromatin regions. We achieved glial enrichment by selecting against
NeuN immunolabeling to achieve 88.47% glial identity from the cortex
and hippocampus. Sub-clustering of each glial cell type revealed
intra-cell-type heterogeneity and diverse activated glial cell
states in the healthy adult human brain. Taken together, we produced
a high cell coverage reference dataset and revealed epigenetic
heterogeneity of glia in the healthy brain, including the presence
of activated subpopulations typically associated with disease
states.

# methods: please describe roughly what the samples are and how you processed them computationally
methods = """
Cryopreserved human specimens, five cortex (middle frontal gyrus)
and four hippocampus from nine cognitively normal individuals
ranging in age from 37-73 years. Nuclei were isolated using nuclear
isolation buffer and dounce homogenization. Nuclei were
immunolabeled using NeuN antibody and the non-neuronal, or glial,
cell population was isolated using fluorescence-activated flow
sorting (FACS) for the NeuN-negative population. The single-cell
combinatorial indexed assay for transposase accessible chromatin
using sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) was performed on all samples to
generate a dataset of 378,270 cells with a total of 779,149 open
chromatin regions. Dimensionality reduction of regional counts
matrices (cortex and hippocampus) and assessment of canonical glial
cell type markers revealed distinct clusters for all expected gross
glial cell types: oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Cell type-specific datasets,
presented here, were generated using Seurat V3. Dimensionality
reduction and Louvain clustering were used to sub-cluster glial cell
types and downstream processing, including generation of gene
activity matrices, was used to characterize the heterogeneity of
glial cell types.
