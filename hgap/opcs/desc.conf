Seurat object of 16,534 oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) derived
from human cortex (middle frontal gyrus) and hippocampus.

# methods: please describe roughly what the samples are and how you processed them computationally
methods = """
Cryopreserved human specimens, five cortex (middle frontal gyrus) and four
hippocampus from nine cognitively normal individuals ranging in age from
37-73 years. Nuclei were isolated using nuclear isolation buffer and
dounce homogenization. Nuclei were immunolabeled using NeuN antibody and
the non-neuronal, or glial, cell population was isolated using
fluorescence-activated flow sorting (FACS) for the NeuN-negative
population. The single-cell combinatorial indexed assay for transposase
accessible chromatin using sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) was performed on all
samples to generate a dataset of 378,270 cells with a total of 779,149
open chromatin regions. Dimensionality reduction of regional counts
matrices (cortex and hippocampus) and assessment of canonical glial cell
type markers revealed distinct clusters for all expected gross glial cell
types: oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, astrocytes, and
microglia. 

The OPC-specific dataset, presented here, was generated using Seurat V3.
To allow for inter-individual assessment of glial cell type heterogeneity,
we corrected for individual-based batch effect by projecting cells from
each individual into shared embeddings using Harmony. Dimensionality
reduction and Louvain clustering revealed two OPC sub-clusters. Downstream
processing includes generation of gene activity matrices from
cis-co-accessibility networks and transcription factor motif enrichment
analysis.
