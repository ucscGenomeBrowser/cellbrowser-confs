Deciphering how neuronal diversity is established and maintained requires a
detailed knowledge of neuronal gene expression throughout development. In
contrast to mammalian brains, the large neuronal diversity of the Drosophila
optic lobe and its connectome are almost completely characterized.
However, a molecular characterization of this neuronal diversity, particularly
during development, has been lacking. Here we present insights into brain
development through a nearly complete description of the transcriptomic
diversity of the optic lobes of Drosophila. We acquired the transcriptome of
275,000 single cells at adult and at five pupal stages, and built a
machine-learning framework to assign them to almost 200 cell types at all time
points during development. We discovered two large neuronal populations that
wrap neuropils during development but die just before adulthood, as well as
neuronal subtypes that partition dorsal and ventral visual circuits by
differential Wnt signalling throughout development. Moreover, we show that the
transcriptomes of neurons that are of the same type but are produced days apart
become synchronized shortly after their production. During synaptogenesis we
also resolved neuronal subtypes that, although differing greatly in morphology
and connectivity, converge to indistinguishable transcriptomic profiles in
adults. Our datasets almost completely account for the known neuronal diversity
of the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobes, and serve as a paradigm to understand brain
development across species.

<section>Integration of scRNA-seq libraries</section>
<p>
We used the procedure implemented in Seurat v.3 to remove batch effects from
our sequenced libraries. In brief, it uses canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
to project the libraries in a low-dimensional space in which their correlation
is maximized. This keeps the variation shared between the libraries (biological
variation) and removes the variation specific to each library (technical
variation). The cells from different libraries that are mutual nearest
neighbours in this shared low-dimensional space are then used as anchors to
calculate a matrix of ‘integrated’ gene expression, using the 2,000 most
variable genes of the dataset, the expression of which is corrected for
batch-effect and used for downstream analysis.
<p>
Using default parameters in Seurat 3.0.0.9000, we first normalized
(NormalizeData) independently each sequenced library of a given stage and
extracted their 2,000 most variable features (FindVariableFeatures). For the
adult stage, we then used the functions FindIntegrationAnchors, IntegrateData,
ScaleData and RunPCA with default parameters, except for the dimensionality for
which we tried the values 100, 150 and 200. To compare the results, we assessed
how much the integrated dataset conserves the structure its individual
libraries had before integration using the Seurat function LocalStruct with
default parameters. This function counts, for each cell of a given library, how
many of its 100 closest neighbours in this library are similar before and after
integration. This is done and averaged for all libraries. The results obtained
were 74%, 81% and 75%, respectively. We therefore chose a dimensionality of 150
for the adult dataset. This procedure conserved the local structure of each
dataset, as the cells shared on average 81% of their closest neighbours before
and after integration, and efficiently removed the batch effects, as our final
adult clusters contained a uniform distribution of cells from each original
library (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Last, we used a dimensionality of 100 for all
pupal datasets owing to their smaller sizes. The values obtained with the
LocalStruct function were P70 = 81%, P50 = 76%, P40 = 83%, P30 = 82%, P15 =
88%.

<section>Clustering of the datasets</section>
<p>
We used Seurat v.3.0.0.9000 to cluster our integrated single-cell
transcriptomes to identify groups of cells with similar gene expression
patterns. For the adult dataset we used the functions FindNeighbours and
FindClusters with default parameters except for the number of principal
components (PCs), which are used to reduce the dataset dimensionality and
calculate the distance between all pairs of cells, and the resolution, which is
used to compensate for the tendency of modularity optimization algorithms to
merge small clusters. Small resolution values favour big clusters, and high
values favour small clusters but tend to artificially split large clusters
(which can be corrected for by subsequent analysis). We therefore performed a
grid search of 90 different combinations of parameters, aiming to optimize the
biological relevance of the resulting clusters.
<p>
We varied the PC number between 100 and 200 (with a step size of 20), and the
resolution between 1 and 15 (step size of 1), which yielded between 146 and 229
clusters (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We assessed the biological relevance of the
clusters obtained with each pair of clustering parameters by using 54
log-normalized bulk-transcriptomes obtained from purified optic lobe neuronal
types: 52 published before and 2 additional types (Pm2 and T4) sequenced
for this study. For each purified neuronal-type transcriptome, we calculated
the Pearson correlation with the average log-normalized non-integrated gene
expression of each cluster, using the list of the most-variable genes found
during the clustering step. We then ranked the clusters by decreasing value of
Pearson correlation. If a cluster has a much higher correlation value than the
others, the cells from this cluster are very likely to belong to this neuronal
type. If several clusters have a much higher correlation value than the others,
they might correspond to similar cell types or to an abundant cell type
artificially separated in several clusters (that is, ‘overclustering’). Thus,
we counted for each pair of clustering parameters how many of the 54 isolated
neuronal-types match to 1 to 5 clusters (that is, we tested, for the 6
best-correlated clusters for each neuronal type, whether the difference in
correlation value between a cluster and the subsequent one was higher than
0.05. If one of these differences was indeed higher than 0.05, we considered
that the neuronal type had at least one matching cluster). The results are
presented in Extended Data Fig. 1d. Increasing the number of PCs decreased this
estimate of the biological relevance, probably because too many non-relevant
principal components dilute the important information, as does increasing the
resolution parameter too much. We chose the pair of clustering parameters (120
PCs and 10 resolution) that maximized both our estimation of biological
relevance and the number of clusters obtained, which resulted in 208 clusters.
<p>
For clustering the pupal datasets, we also used 120 PCs but a lower resolution
of 6 owing to their smaller size. We obtained 147 clusters from the P70
dataset, 137 clusters in P50, 135 clusters in P40, 145 clusters in P30 and 134
clusters in P15. We did not perform additional parameter tuning for either
integration or clustering of these datasets, nor did we comprehensively assess
the quality of these unsupervised clusters (as we do in the following section
for adult), because the pupal datasets were primarily annotated in a supervised
manner using log-normalized non-integrated expression matrices.

<section>Statistical significance of the clusters</section
<p>
Because keeping small clusters separate using a modularity optimization
algorithm results in artificially splitting large clusters, before annotation
of the adult dataset we merged all pairs of clusters that were improperly
separated (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f). To do so, we first built a tree grouping
the clusters on the basis of the similarity of their average log-normalized
non-integrated gene expression, using the Seurat v.2 function BuildClusterTree.
For each node, we then trained a random-forest model using the Seurat v.2
function AssessNodes to predict to which branch of the node a given cell should
be assigned. The accuracy of the model is measured by the out-of-bag error
(OOBE), which is similar to the percentage of cells misclassified by the model.
If a node arbitrarily separates the cells, the random-forest model will not be
able to ‘learn’ this split and the OOBE will be high. Thus, we merged all pairs
of clusters connected to a node for which the random-forest model prediction
differed from the actual clustering with an OOBE >5%, and if the two clusters
did not have clearly differentially expressed genes. To do so, we calculated
their cluster markers and decided whether to merge the clusters on a case by
case basis, based on the number of genes differentially expressed, the P
values, and the identity of these genes. Notably, most of the merged clusters
either matched to the same cell type during the annotation step (see section
‘Annotation of the adult dataset’) and/or were clearly containing a different
proportion a low-quality transcriptomes (that is, the merged clusters differed
not by gene expression but by their content of cells with high levels of
mitochondrial genes, or low number of UMI/genes expressed). Last, although this
is unlikely, we cannot entirely discard the possibility that some merged
clusters correspond to real neuronal subtypes. They are thus still accessible
to study in our adult dataset because the metadata field ‘Clustering’ contains
the identities of the initial unsupervised clusters.
<p>
Similarly, we used the Seurat v2 function BuildClusterTree on the T4/T5
subtypes (Extended Data Fig. 10), and the function AssessNodes to evaluate the
statistical significance of the separation between several pairs of clusters
throughout this study (Dm3a and Dm3b, Tm9v and Tm9d, Tm4v and Tm4d, cluster 62
Wnt4+Wnt10− and Wnt4−Wnt10+ cells) and during the process of annotating the
pupal stages (see section ‘Backprojection of the developmental splits’). Last,
we used the Seurat v.3.1.0 function BuildClusterTree to produce Extended Data
Fig. 5a.
