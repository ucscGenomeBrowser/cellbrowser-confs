<p>
The gene expression program underlying the specification of human cell types is
of fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of gene expression and
chromatin accessibility in fetal tissues. For gene expression, we applied
three-level combinatorial indexing to >110 samples representing 15 organs,
ultimately profiling ~4 million single cells. We leveraged the literature and
other atlases to identify and annotate hundreds of cell types and subtypes,
both within and across tissues. Our analyses focused on organ-specific
specializations of broadly distributed cell types (such as blood, endothelial,
and epithelial), sites of fetal erythropoiesis (which notably included the
adrenal gland), and integration with mouse developmental atlases (such as
conserved specification of blood cells). These data represent a rich resource
for the exploration of in vivo human gene expression in diverse tissues and
cell types.

<section>Clustering analysis of cells across organs</section>
<p>
For clustering analysis of 77 main cell types across 15 organs, we sampled 5000
cells from each cell type (or all cells for cell types with <5000 cells in a
given organ). The dimensionality of the data was reduced first by PCA (50
components) on the gene set combining top cell type–specific gene markers
identified above (table S5, q value = 0) and then with UMAP (max_components =
2, n_neighbors = 50, min_dist = 0.1, metric = 'cosine'). Differentially
expressed genes across cell types were identified with the
differentialGeneTest() function of Monocle 3. For annotating cell type–specific
gene features, we intersected the cell type–specific genes identified above
with the predicted secreted and membrane protein coding gene sets from the
Human Protein Atlas (189), as well as the TF set annotated in the
“motifAnnotations_hgnc” data from package RcisTarget/v1.2.1 (190).
<p>
For clustering analysis of blood cell across 15 organs, we extracted all blood
cells corresponding to annotated clusters of myeloid cells, lymphoid cells,
thymocytes, megakaryocytes, microglia, antigen presenting cells, erythroblasts,
and HSPCs. The dimensionality of the data was reduced first by PCA (40
components) on the expression of a gene set combining the top 3000 blood cell
type–specific gene markers (table S5, only genes specifically expressed in at
least one blood cell type were selected (q < 0.05, fold expression difference
between first and second ranked cell cluster > 2) and ordered by median q value
across organs) and then with UMAP (max_components = 2, n_neighbors = 50,
min_dist = 0.1, metric = 'cosine'). Cell clusters were identified using the
Louvain algorithm implemented in Monocle 3 (louvain_res = 1 × 10−4). Clusters
were assigned to known cell types on the basis of cell type–specific markers.
We then coembedded the human fetal blood cells and a scRNA-seq atlas of blood
cells from the fetal liver (108), using the Seurat v3 integration method
(FindAnchors and IntegrateData) (15) with a chosen dimensionality of 30 on the
top 3000 highly variable genes with shared gene names in both datasets.
<p>
We then applied a similar analysis strategy as above for clustering analysis of
endothelial or epithelial cells across organs. For endothelial cells, we first
extracted cells corresponding to annotated clusters of vascular endothelial
cells, lymphatic endothelial cells and endocardial cells across organs. The
dimensionality of the data was reduced first by PCA (30 components) on the gene
set combining top 1000 endothelial cell type–specific gene markers identified
above (table S5, only genes specifically expressed in at least one endothelial
cell type were selected (q < 0.05, fold expression difference between first and
second ranked cell cluster > 2) and ordered by median q value across organs)
and then with UMAP with the same parameters used for blood cells. Cell clusters
were identified using the Louvain algorithm implemented in Monocle 3
(louvain_res = 1 × 10−4), and then annotated on the basis of the tissue origin
of endothelial cells. For epithelial cells, we first extracted cells from the
epithelial cell cluster in fig. S4B, followed by dimension reduction first by
PCA (50 components) first on the top 5000 most highly dispersed genes and then
with UMAP (max_components = 2, n_neighbors = 50, min_dist = 0.1, metric =
'cosine'). For validating the tissue specific endothelial cells, we then
coembedded the human fetal endothelial cells and a scRNA-seq atlas of
endothelial cells from mouse adult tissues (139), using the Seurat v3
integration method (FindAnchors and IntegrateData) (15) with a chosen
dimensionality of 30 on the top 3000 highly variable genes with shared gene
names in both datasets.
