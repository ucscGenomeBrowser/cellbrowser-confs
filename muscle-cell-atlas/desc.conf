Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitates the unbiased reconstruction
of multicellular tissue systems in health and disease. Here, we present a
curated scRNA-seq dataset of human muscle samples from 10 adult donors with
diverse anatomical locations. We integrated ~ 22,000 single-cell transcriptomes
using Scanorama to account for technical and biological variation and resolved
16 distinct populations of muscle-resident cells using unsupervised clustering
of the data compendium. These cell populations included muscle stem/progenitor
cells (MuSCs), which bifurcated into discrete “quiescent” and “early-activated”
MuSC subpopulations. Differential expression analysis identified
transcriptional profiles altered in the activated MuSCs including genes
associated with aging, obesity, diabetes, and impaired muscle regeneration, as
well as long non-coding RNAs previously undescribed in human myogenic cells.
Further, we modeled ligand-receptor cell-communication interactions and
observed enrichment of the TWEAK-FN14 pathway in activated MuSCs, a
characteristic signature of muscle wasting diseases. In contrast, the quiescent
MuSCs have enhanced expression of the EGFR receptor, a recognized human MuSC
marker. This work provides a new benchmark reference resource to examine human
muscle tissue heterogeneity and identify potential targets in MuSC diversity
and dysregulation in disease contexts.

<section>Muscle digestion and single-cell sequencing library preparation</section>
<p>
After collection from donors during surgery, the muscle samples were cleared
from excessive fat and connective tissue and weighted. About 50–65 mg of tissue
was then digested into a single-cell suspension following a previously reported
protocol [63]. Briefly, the specimen was digested in 8 mg/mL Collagenase D
(Roche) and 4.8 U/mL Dispase II (Roche) for 1 h followed by manual
dissociation, filtration, and red blood cell lysis (Table 1). All single-cell
suspensions were then frozen at -80 °C in 90% FBS, 10% DMSO and were
re-filtered after thawing and prior to generating scRNA-seq libraries. The
sequencing libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3' reagent V2
or V3 kit (10X Genomics) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol and
diluted as to yield a recovery of ~ 6000 single-cell transcriptomes with < 5%
doublet rate (Table 1). The libraries were sequenced in multiplex (n = 2 per
sequencing run) on the NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina) to produce between 200
and 250 million reads per library.

<section>Single-cell data analysis</section>
<p>
Sequencing reads were processed with the Cell Ranger version 3.1 (10X Genomics)
using the human reference transcriptome GRCh38. The downstream analysis was
carried out with R 3.6.1 (2019-07-05). Quality control filtering, data
clustering, visualization, and differential gene expression analysis was
carried out using Seurat 3.1.0 R package [14]. Each of the 10 datasets was
first analyzed and annotated independently before integration with Scanorama
[13] (Table 1). Filtering retained cells with > 1000 unique molecular
identifiers (UMIs), < 20% UMIs mapped to mitochondrial genes, and genes
expressed in at least 3 cells (Fig. S4). Unsupervised shared nearest neighbor
(SNN) clustering was performed with a resolution of 0.4 following which
clusters were annotated with a common nomenclature of 12 cell type terms (Fig.
S1). Differential expression analysis was achieved using either Seurat’s
“FindAllMarkers” (Fig. 1d) or “FindMarkers” (Fig. 2a) function using a Wilcoxon
Rank Sum test and only considering genes with > log2(0.25) fold-change and
expressed in at least 25% of cells in the cluster. P values were corrected for
false-discovery (FDR) and then reported as q values. Integration of raw counts
was achieved using the “scanorama.correct” function from Scanorama. The
integrated values were finally scaled in Seurat regressing out the 10X
chemistry type and the number of genes per cell. Visualization was done using
uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) [66]. In Fig. S2, we
integrated these human scRNA-seq datasets with a cohort of adult mouse muscle
scRNA-seq datasets collected 0–7 days post-notexin injury [30]. For
multi-species integration, scRNA-seq datasets were integrated using first
Scanorama and then Harmony [54] to align related cell populations across
species. Mouse genes were converted to human orthologs using biomaRt
Bioconductor R package [64] (Table 1). For differential expression analysis
between human and mouse samples, we compared human MuSCs (combining MuSC1 + 2
clusters) and the uninjured mouse MuSCs to focus on cells from the homeostatic
conditions.
