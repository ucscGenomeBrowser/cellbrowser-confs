<p>
Recognition of environmental cues is essential for the survival of all
organisms. Transcriptional changes occur to enable the generation and function
of the neural circuits underlying sensory perception. To gain insight into
these changes, we generated single-cell transcriptomes of Drosophila olfactory-
(ORNs), thermo-, and hygro-sensory neurons at an early developmental and adult
stage using single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We discovered that
ORNs maintain expression of the same olfactory receptors across development.
Using receptor expression and computational approaches, we matched
transcriptomic clusters corresponding to anatomically and physiologically
defined neuron types across multiple developmental stages. We found that
cell-type-specific transcriptomes partly reflected axon trajectory choices in
development and sensory modality in adults. We uncovered stage-specific genes
that could regulate the wiring and sensory responses of distinct ORN types.
Collectively, our data reveal transcriptomic features of sensory neuron biology
and provide a resource for future studies of their development and physiology.

<section>Sequence alignment and preprocessing</section>
Reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster genome (r6.10) using STAR
(2.5.4) (Dobin et al., 2013). Gene counts were produced using HTseq (0.11.2)
with default settings except '-m intersection-strict' (Anders et al., 2015).
Gene counts of scRNA-seq were generated using exonic GTF files. Gene counts of
snRNA-seq were generated using both exonic and intronic GTF files, and the two
gene count tables were merged for analysis. Low-quality cells/nuclei having
fewer than 50,000 uniquely mapped reads were removed.

<section>Dimensionality Reduction</section>
<p>
Principal component analysis (PCA) followed by t-distributed Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE; van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) was used to jointly
visualize cells/nuclei from all stages. Briefly, we obtained two-dimensional
projections of cell population by first reducing the dimensionality of the gene
expression matrix and then projecting these genes in to the t-SNE space.
