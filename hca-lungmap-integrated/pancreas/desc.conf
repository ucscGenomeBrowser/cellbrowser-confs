Summary from Broad Single Cell Portal:
<p>
Hormone-secreting cells within pancreatic islets of Langerhans play important
roles in metabolic homeostasis and disease. However, their transcriptional
characterization is still incomplete. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of
thousands of human islet cells from healthy and type 2 diabetic donors. We
could define specific genetic programs for each individual endocrine and
exocrine cell type, even for rare δ, γ, ε, and stellate cells, and revealed
subpopulations of α, β, and acinar cells. Intriguingly, δ cells expressed
several important receptors, indicating an unrecognized importance of these
cells in integrating paracrine and systemic metabolic signals. Genes previously
associated with obesity or diabetes were found to correlate with BMI. Finally,
comparing healthy and T2D transcriptomes in a cell-type resolved manner
uncovered candidates for future functional studies. Altogether, our analyses
demonstrate the utility of the generated single-cell gene expression resource.
