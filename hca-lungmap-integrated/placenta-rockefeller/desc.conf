Abstract from Suryawanshi et al:
<p>
The placenta and decidua interact dynamically to enable embryonic and fetal
development. Here, we report single-cell RNA sequencing of 14,341 and 6754
cells from first-trimester human placental villous and decidual tissues,
respectively. Bioinformatic analysis identified major cell types, many known
and some subtypes previously unknown in placental villi and decidual context.
Further detailed analysis revealed proliferating subpopulations, enrichment of
cell typeâ€“specific transcription factors, and putative intercellular
communication in the fetomaternal microenvironment. This study provides a
blueprint to further the understanding of the roles of these cells in the
placenta and decidua for maintenance of early gestation as well as pathogenesis
in pregnancy-related disorders.
