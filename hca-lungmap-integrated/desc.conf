The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, creates an
urgent need for identifying molecular mechanisms that mediate viral entry,
propagation, and tissue pathology. Cell membrane bound angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of
SARS-CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression
of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell
and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16
unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of
ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory
epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages,
airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also
identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with
COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal
epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular
cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of
scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung
parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and
elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in
specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which
are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably,
there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric
samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program
shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes
that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate
epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and
co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type
specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice.
Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type-specific expression of
mediators of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID-19
epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways
involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.
