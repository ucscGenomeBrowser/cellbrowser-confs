<p>
Neuroanatomists have long speculated that expanded primate brains contain an
increased morphological diversity of inhibitory neurons (doi:10.1038/nrn3444,
DeFelipe et al.; Ramón y Cajal) and recent studies have identified
primate-specific neuronal populations at the molecular
level(doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0205-2, Boldog et al.;
doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2781-z, Krienen et al.). However, we know little about
the developmental mechanisms that specify evolutionarily novel cell types in
the brain. Here, we reconstructed gene expression trajectories specifying
inhibitory neurons spanning the neurogenic period in macaque and mouse by
analyzing the transcriptomes of 250,181 cells. We find that the initial classes
of inhibitory neurons generated prenatally are largely conserved among mammals.
Nonetheless, we discover  two contrasting developmental mechanisms for
specifying evolutionarily novel cell types during prenatal development. First,
we show that recently-identified primate-specific TAC3 striatal interneurons
are specified by a unique transcriptional program in progenitors followed by
induction of a distinct suite of neuropeptides and neurotransmitter receptors
in newborn neurons. Second, we find that multiple classes of
transcriptionally-conserved olfactory-bulb bound precursors are redirected to
expanded primate white matter and striatum, including a novel peristriatal
class, striatum laureatum neurons, that resemble dopaminergic periglomerular
cells of the olfactory bulb. We propose an evolutionary “reduce and reuse”
model of inhibitory neuron distribution that accounts for the unequal scaling
of primate olfactory bulb, source progenitor domains, and cortical white
matter. Together, our results provide a unified developmental taxonomy of
initial classes of mammalian inhibitory neurons and reveal multiple
developmental mechanisms for neural cell type evolution.

methods = """
Dissociated whole cells from regions dissected from the developing macaque
cerebrum run on 10X Genomics V2 and 3 3' capture scRNAseq. Reads were
quantified using kallisto-bustools, ambient RNA removed using cellbender,
followed by normalization, scaling and PCA. The KNN corrects for batch using
BBKNN.
