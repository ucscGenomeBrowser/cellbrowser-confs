Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals experience mild coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), some patients suffer from severe COVID-19, which is
accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation.
To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed
single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained
from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with
severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory
signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly up-regulation of
the TNF/IL-1β-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In
classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I IFN response
co-existed with the TNF/IL-1β-driven inflammation, and this was not seen in
patients with milder COVID-19. Interestingly, we documented type I IFN-driven
inflammatory features in patients with severe influenza as well. Based on this,
we propose that the type I IFN response plays a pivotal role in exacerbating
inflammation in severe COVID-19.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral venous
blood via standard Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) density
gradient centrifugation, frozen in freezing media, and stored in liquid
nitrogen until use. All samples showed a high viability of about 90% on average
after thawing. Single-cell RNA-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium
Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10X genomics, Pleasanton, CA)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, thousands of cells were
separated into nanoliter-scale droplets. In each droplet, cDNA was generated
through reverse transcription. As a result, a cell barcoding sequence and
Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) were added to each cDNA molecule. Libraries
were constructed and sequenced as a depth of approximately 50,000 reads per
cell using the Nextseq 550 or Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

<section>Single-cell RNA-seq data processing</section>
The sequenced data were de-multiplexed using mkfastq (cellranger 10X genomics,
v3.0.2) to generate fastq files. After de-multiplexing, the reads were aligned
to the human reference genome (GRCh38; 10x cellranger reference GRCh38 v3.0.0),
feature-barcode matrices generated using the cellranger count, and then
aggregated by cellranger aggr using default parameters. The following analysis
was performed using Seurat R package v3.1.5 (17). After generating the
feature-barcode matrix, we discarded cells that expressed <200 genes and genes
not expressed in any cells. To exclude low-quality cells from our data, we
filtered out the cells that express mitochondrial genes in >15% of their total
gene expression as described in previous studies (29, 35, 36). Doublets were
also excluded, which were dominant in the cluster “Uncategorized 1”. Although
there was a high variability in the number of UMIs detected per cell, majority
of cells (90.5%) were enriched in a reasonable range of the UMIs (1,000 -
25,000), and 59% of cells with less than 1,000 UMIs were platelet or RBC
excluded in downstream analysis. In each cell, the gene expression was
normalized based on the total read count and log-transformed. To align the
cells originating from different samples, 2000 highly variable genes from each
sample were identified by the vst method in Seurat R package v3.1.5 (17). Using
the canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we found anchors and aligned the
samples based on the top 15 canonical correlation vectors. The aligned samples
were scaled and principal component analysis (PCA) conducted. Finally, the
cells were clustered by unsupervised clustering (0.5 resolution) and visualized
by tSNE using the top 15 principal components.
