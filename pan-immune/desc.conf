Despite their crucial role in health and disease, our knowledge of immune cells
within human tissues remains limited. Here, we surveyed the immune compartment
of 16 tissues from 12 adult donors by single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ
sequencing generating a dataset of 360,000 cells. To systematically resolve
immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine
learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach,
combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of
finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated
tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our
multi-tissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved
immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated
expression analysis and antigen receptor sequencing.

#<section>Single-cell RNA library preparation and sequencing</section>
#For scRNA-seq experiments, single cells were loaded onto the channels of a
#Chromium chip (10x Genomics) for a target recovery of 5,000 cells. Immune cells
#from donors A29, A31, A35, A36, A37, A52 were loaded into a single 10X channel
#per tissue per donor. For the remaining donors, as the cells were hashtag
#labelled, each donor’s cells were pooled and loaded into a maximum of sixteen
#10X channels. Single-cell cDNA synthesis, amplification, and sequencing
#libraries were generated using either the Single Cell 5′ Reagent (v1 and v2)
#(Cambridge University) or 3′ Reagent (v3) (Columbia University) Kit from 10X
#Genomics following the manufacturer’s instructions. The gene expression
#libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform at a target depth
#of 50,000 reads per cell. For samples prepared with the Single Cell 5′ Reagent
#Kit, VDJ libraries for TCRαβ and BCR were prepared following the manufacturer’s
#instructions and VDJ libraries for TCRγδ were prepared using previously
#published primers compatible with the Single Cell 5′ Reagent (v1) Kit from
#10X Genomics. VDJ libraries for B and T cells were sequenced on either a HiSeq
#4000 or pooled with gene expression libraries on the NovaSeq 6000 platform at a
#target depth of 5,000 reads per cell. Hashtag libraries were pooled and sequenced 
#on either an Illumina NextSeq 500, Illumina HiSeq 4000 or pooled with gene 
#expression libraries on the NovaSeq 6000 platform.

#<section>Single-cell RNA-seq data pre-processing</section>
#scRNA-seq data was aligned and quantified using the cellranger software
#(version 6.1.1, 10x Genomics Inc.) using the GRCh38 human reference genome
#(official Cell Ranger reference, version 1.2.0). For donors hashtagged and
#multiplexed samples (applies to donors 582C, 621B, 637C, 640C, D496 and D503)
#hashtag-based cell demultiplexing was performed using Hashsolo. Cells with
#fewer than 1,000 UMI counts and 600 detected genes were excluded from
#downstream analysis. scTCR-seq data was aligned and quantified using the
#cellranger-vdj software (version 2.1.1, 10x Genomics Inc). scBCR-seq data was
#aligned and quantified using the cellranger-vdj software (version 4.0, 10x
#Genomics Inc). For TCRγδ we implemented a customized pipeline due to the cell
#ranger vdj annotation algorithm being tuned towards alpha/beta TCR chains.
#Briefly, TCRγδ libraries were mapped with cell ranger 4.0.0, using the 10x VDJ
#4.0.0 reference. All contigs deemed high quality were selected, and reannotated
#with IgBlast via the workflow provided in 
#<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion">dandelion 0.1.3</a>.
