<p>
Despite signs of infection, the involvement of the oral cavity in COVID-19 is
poorly understood. To address this, single-cell RNA sequencing data-sets were
integrated from human minor salivary glands and gingiva to identify 11
epithelial, 7 mesenchymal, and 15 immune cell clusters. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2
viral entry factor expression showed enrichment in epithelia including the
ducts and acini of the salivary glands and the suprabasal cells of the mucosae.
COVID-19 autopsy tissues confirmed in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection in the salivary
glands and mucosa. Saliva from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored
epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Matched
nasopharyngeal and saliva samples found distinct viral shedding dynamics and
viral burden in saliva correlated with COVID-19 symptoms including taste loss.
Upon recovery, this cohort exhibited salivary antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
proteins. Collectively, the oral cavity represents a robust site for COVID-19
infection and implicates saliva in viral transmission.

<section>Single-cell capture, library preparation and sequencing</section>
<p>
Single cell suspensions targeting approximately 5,000 cells were prepared as
described above and loaded onto a 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Chip B
following manufacturer’s recommendations. After cell capture, single-cell
library preparation was performed following the instructions for the 10×
Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ kit v3 (10x Genomics). The libraries were
pooled and sequenced on four lanes of a NextSeq500 sequencer (Illumina),
adopting the read configuration indicated by the manufacturer. Single-cell
RNA-seq data processing and quality control: Read processing was performed
using the 10x Genomics workflow. Briefly, the Cell Ranger v3.0.1 Single-Cell
Software Suite was used for demultiplexing, barcode assignment, and unique
molecular identifier (UMI) quantification
http://software.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/overview/welcome). Sequencing reads
were aligned to the hg38 reference genome (Genome Reference Consortium Human
Build 38) using a pre-built annotation package obtained from the 10X Genomics
website
(https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cellgeneexpression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references).
Samples were demultiplexed using the ‘cell ranger mkfastq’ function and gene
counts matrices were generated using the ‘cellranger count’ function. The
single cell data was analyzed in R (v3.5.0) using Seurat (v3.1.2). Filtering
was performed using the standard quality control steps provided on the Satija
Lab website (satijalab.org). Cells containing more than 200 and less than 2,500
unique features were retained. From this set, cells with greater than fifteen
percent of read counts attributed to mitochondrial DNA were filtered out. We
adjusted this value from five to fifteen percent to increase the yield from
each sample and did not observe substantive changes in our results after
adjustment. Data were normalized using the “NormalizeData” command (scale
factor = 10,000).

<section>Annotation of clusters</section>
<p>
SG cells from n=5 non-Sjögren’s syndrome and otherwise healthy subjects were
integrated into a single Seurat object containing 12 clusters at
resolution=0.1. The clusters were manually annotated with marker genes
identified by Seurat’s “FindAllMarkers” function, using the receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) test. The “FeaturePlot” function was used to identify
subpopulations within identified clusters and confirm the expression of known
marker genes within clusters.

<section>Clustering and Annotation</section>
<p>
Oral atlases were retrieved from published and
unpublished datasets (human salivary glands: Warner et al.; human
gin-giva/palatal mucosa: Byrd et al.). Raw expression matrices were filtered,
normalized and log transformed for further processing using standard SCANPY
(v.1.4.3) procedure (68). For the published mouse datasets, we considered
original publication annotations when re-processing and annotating cell types.
For the two unpublished human datasets, BBKNN was used for batch correction
across samples and multiple clustering rounds of different resolutions were
performed to resolve subpopulations and then manual annotations were made
considering published human and mouse references (69). For integration across
datasets, each individual dataset was first randomly down-sampled to having
<=500 cells per cell type, then pooled raw expression values were re-processed
following standard SCANPY procedure while using Harmony for correcting batch
effects across datasets and samples (70). Again, multiple clustering rounds of
different resolutions were performed, and manual annotations were made.
Illustration of the results were generated using python code around SCANPY.
