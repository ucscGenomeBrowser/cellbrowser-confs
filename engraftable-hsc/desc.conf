The human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) harbors remarkable regenerative potential that can
be harnessed therapeutically. During early development, HSCs in the fetal liver (FL) undergo
active expansion while simultaneously retaining robust engraftment capacity. Yet, the underlying
molecular program responsible for their efficient engraftment remains unclear. We profiled
26,407 FL cells at both transcriptional and protein levels including over 7,000 highly enriched
and functional FL HSCs to establish a detailed molecular signature of engraftment potential.
Integration of transcript and linked cell surface marker expression revealed a generalizable
signature defining functional FL HSCs and allowed for the stratification of enrichment strategies
with high translational potential. Using a multi-modal profiling approach, this comprehensive
characterization of engraftment capacity connects a critical biological function at a key
developmental timepoint with its underlying molecular drivers, serving as a useful resource for
the field.

# methods: please describe roughly what the samples are and how you processed them computationally
methods = """
The four samples were merged and then normalized using SCTransform with cell
degradation and cell-cycle effects regressed out. The UMAP dimensionality
reduction calculated from the expression matrix PCA was used to represent the
gene expression data and the surface protein (ADT) data. The Louvain algorithm
was used for clustering and the optimal clustering resolution was chosen by
expert evaluation.
