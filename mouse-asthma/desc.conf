Neutrophilic asthma is associated with increased disease severity and poor
response to glucocorticosteroids, but the role of neutrophils in asthma remains
controversial. This study intended to elucidate the disease-related
heterogeneity of neutrophils. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) on lung tissue obtained from mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-induced
chronic allergic asthma and profiled the transcriptomes of 36988 mice lung
cells. We found 4 neutrophil subsets with distinct markers, named C0 to C3, and
cells of the C1 subset were significantly increased in the OVA group. Innate
immune memory is characterized by epigenetic reprogramming of cells mediated by
transcription factors, which regulates both inflammation and immunological
tolerance and may play an important role in airway inflammation and allergic
asthma. We found that cells of the C1 subset were characterized by a group of
transcriptional changes that participate in innate immune memory, therefore, we
define them as memory neutrophils which can be identified as G-CSFR+FcγRIIb+.
We validated the existence of the C1 subset by using Immunofluorescence
staining (n=5) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, n=8), and further
validated the upregulated expression of the molecular features of innate immune
memory in the FcγRIIb+ memory neutrophils using qPCR and western blots. In
addition, we found that the C1 subset showed upregulated inflammatory pathways
by functional enrichment analysis. In conclusion, this study identified a
population of inflammatory neutrophils with specific molecular features of
innate immune memory for the first time. It is expected that inflammatory
memory neutrophils may aggravate asthma, and serve as novel therapeutic targets
of neutrophilic asthma.
