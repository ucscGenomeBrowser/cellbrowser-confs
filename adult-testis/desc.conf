Human adult spermatogenesis balances spermatogonial stem cell (SSC)
self-renewal and differentiation, alongside complex germ cell-niche
interactions, to ensure long-term fertility and faithful genome propagation.
Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of ~6500 testicular cells from
young adults. We found five niche/somatic cell types (Leydig, myoid, Sertoli,
endothelial, macrophage), and observed germline-niche interactions and key
human-mouse differences. Spermatogenesis, including meiosis, was reconstructed
computationally, revealing sequential coding, non-coding, and repeat-element
transcriptional signatures. Interestingly, we identified five discrete
transcriptional/developmental spermatogonial states, including a novel early
SSC state, termed State 0. Epigenetic features and nascent transcription
analyses suggested developmental plasticity within spermatogonial States. To
understand the origin of State 0, we profiled testicular cells from infants,
and identified distinct similarities between adult State 0 and infant SSCs.
Overall, our datasets describe key transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of
the normal adult human testis, and provide new insights into germ cell
developmental transitions and plasticity.

<section>Single cell RNA-seq performance, library preparation and sequencing</section>
<p>
scRNA-Seq was performed using the 10× Genomics system. Briefly, each experiment
captured ~1500 single cells, in order to obtain ~0.8% multiplex rate. Cells
were diluted following manufacturer recommendations, and mixed with 33.8 µL of
total mixed buffer before being loaded into 10× Chromium Controller using
Chromium Single Cell 3’ v2 reagents. Each sequencing library was prepared
following the manufacturer’s instructions, with 13 cycles used for cDNA
amplification. Then ~100 ng of cDNA were used for library amplification by 12
cycles. The resulting libraries were then sequenced on a 26 × 100 cycle
paired-end run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument.

<section>Process of single cell RNA-seq data</section>
<p>
Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed using the mkfastq application (Cell
Ranger v1.2.1). Three types of fastq files were generated: I1 contains 8 bp
sample index; R1 contains 26 bp (10 bp cell-BC + 16 bp UMI) index and R2
contains 100 bp cDNA sequence. Fastq files were then run with the cellranger
count application (Cell Ranger v1.2.1) using default settings, to perform
alignment (using STAR v2.5.4a), filtering and cellular barcode and UMI
counting. The UMI count tables of each cellular barcode were used for further
analysis.

<section>Cell type identification and clustering analysis using Seurat program</section>
<p>
The Seurat program (http://satijalab.org/seurat/, R package, v.2.0.0) was
firstly applied for analysis of RNA-Sequencing data. To start with, UMI count
tables from each replicates and donors were loaded into R using Read10X
function, and Seurat objects were built from each experiment. Each experiment
was filtered and normalized with default settings. Specifically, cells were
retained only when they had greater than 500 genes expressed, and less than 20%
reads mapped to mitochondrial genome. We first ran t-SNE and the clustering
analysis for each replicate, which resulted in similar t-SNE map. Next, to
minimize variation between technical replicates, we normalized and combined
technical replicates from the same donor using the 10× Genomics built-in
application from Cell Ranger “cellrange aggr”. Data matrices from different
donors were then loaded into R using Seurat. Next, cells were normalized to the
total UMI read count as well as mitochondrial read percentage, as instructed in
the manufacturer’s manual (http://satijalab.org/seurat/). Seurat objects
(matrices from different donors) were then combined using RunCCA function.
t-SNE and clustering analyses were then performed on the combined dataset using
the top 5000 highly variable genes and PCs 1–15, which showed most significant
p-values. Given the low number of Sertoli cells (underrepresented due to size
filtering), the initial clustering analysis did not identify them as a separate
cluster. We performed deeper clustering of somatic cells, identified the
Sertoli cell cluster, and projected it back to the overall clusters, which
resulted in 13 discrete cell clusters. Correlation of different replicates was
calculated based on average expression (normalized UMIs by Seurat) in each
experiment.
