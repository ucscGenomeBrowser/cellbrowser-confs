abstract = "To gain insight into human pancreas development, we created a single cell transcriptome atlas of the human fetal pancreas between 7 and 10 post-conceptional weeks of development. We then established a human pancreas culture system starting from human pluripotent stem cells. This system enables the maintenance of pancreas progenitors for at least 20 passages in a minimal, defined medium in three-dimensions. The same conditions also enable the expansion of pancreas progenitors derived from fetal tissue. We benchmarked the cells produced in 2D using two different protocols and those expanded in 3D from these two conditions to fetal tissue as well as to the fetal tissue cultured in the same 3D conditions."

methods = "<section>Human samples</section>Human fetal pancreas tissue was obtained from material available following elective termination of pregnancy during the 1st trimester at the Departments of Gynaecology at Copenhagen University Hospital (Rigshospitalet) and Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark. The regional ethics committee approved this study (permit number H-1-2012-007) and women gave their informed written and oral consent. None of the terminations were for reasons of pathology of pregnancy or fetal abnormality. Fetal age was determined by scanning crown-rump length and by evaluation of foot length and is indicated as estimated weeks + days post conception (Evtouchenko et al., 1996). The pancreas was isolated and the majority of the mesenchyme was removed manually.<br><section>Human pluripotent stem cell lines and culture conditions</section> The H9 and H1 human embryonic stem cell lines were obtained from WiCell. The SBAD3.1 and SBAD3.4 iPSC lines were obtained from the stemBANCC consortium. The HuES4 PDX1-GFP reporter hESC line was previously reported (Ameri et al., 2017)(Ameriet al., 2017). All cell lines were approved for use in this project by De Videnskabsetiske Komiteer, Region Hovedstadenunder number H-4-2013-057. The hPSC lines were maintained in different conditions depending on the differentiation protocol to be performed. In the case of the protocol based on (Ameri et al., 2010)), the cells were maintained in the DEF-CS 500 (Takara). In the case of the protocol based on (Rezania et al., 2014) the cells were maintained in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies) on hESC-Qualified LDEV-free Matrigel (Corning). Daily medium changes were performed and all cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were tested for mycoplasma free status regularly. When reaching approximately 80% confluence, cells were dissociated with TrypLE (Thermo Fisher), counted with the automated cell counter NucleoCounter NC-200 (ChemoMetec), washed in culture medium, and re-plated at a density of 40.000 cells / cm2. For passaging, mTeSR1 medium was supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Sigma) for the initial 24 hours.<br><section>In vitro generation of pancreatic progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells</section>We generated pancreatic progenitors with two distinct protocols. Human PSCs were grown for at least three passages before starting the differentiation procedure.<br>Protocol adapted from (Ameri et al., 2010):hPSCs (HuES4) were passaged as usual and allowed to reach confluency. Medium was changed daily and 1x PBS (Thermo Fisher) and washes were performed when changing media between stages. Cells were cultured in 2D through all stages of the protocols. Stage 1 (1 day):Cells were exposed to RPMI GlutaMAX medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 100ng/ml Activin A (Peprotech), 3 µM CHIR 99021 (Axon), and B-27 supplement without insulin (Thermo Fisher).Stage 2 (4 days): Cells were exposed to RPMI GlutaMAX medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml Activin A and B-27 supplement without insulin. Stage 3 (3 days): Cells were exposed to DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 2µM Retinoic Acid (RA; Sigma), and B-27 supplement (Thermo Fisher). Stage 4 (8 days): Cells were exposed to DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX medium supplemented with 64 ng/ml FGF2 (Peprotech) and B-27 supplement.<br>Protocol modified from (Rezania et al., 2014):hPSCs (H9, H1, SBAD3.1 and SBAD3.4) were passaged into plates coated with growth factor reduced Matrigel (GFR-Matrigel; Corning) diluted 1/30 in DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX. Cells were seeded at 200.000-350.000 cells/cm2 in mTeSR1 with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and incubated until confluent (24-48 hours depending on the specific cell line). Medium was changed daily and 1x PBS washes were performed when changing media with different supplementation. Cells were cultured in 2D through all stages of the protocol. Stage 1 (3 days): Cells were exposed to MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 1.5g/L sodium bicarbonate, 1× Glutamax (Thermo Fisher), 10 mM glucose (Fisher Scientific) and 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; Proliant). The medium was further supplemented with 3 µM CHIR 99021 and 100 ng/ml Activin A for the first 24h, then 0.3 µM CHIR99021 and 100 ng/ml Activin A the following day, and 100 ng/ml Activin A for the final day. Stage 2 (2 days): Cells were exposed to MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 1.5g/L sodium bicarbonate, 1× Glutamax, 10 mM glucose, 0.5% BSA, 0.25 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma) and 50 ng/ml FGF7 (Peprotech). Stage 3 (2 days): Cells were exposed to MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 2.5g/L sodium bicarbonate, 1× Glutamax, 10 mM glucose, 2% BSA, 0.25 mM ascorbic acid, 1:200 ITS-X (Thermo Fisher), 50 ng/ml FGF7, 1 µm RA, 0.25 µM Sant-1 (Sigma), 100 nM LDN193189 (LDN; Stemgent) and 200 nM TPB (EMD Millipore). Stage 4 (3 days): Cells were exposed to MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 2.5g/L sodium bicarbonate, 1× Glutamax, 10 mM glucose , 2% BSA, 0.25 mM ascorbic acid, 1:200 ITS-X, 2 ng/ml FGF7, 0.1 µm retinoic acid, 0.25 µM Sant-1, 200 nM LDN and 100 nM TPB.<br><section>Generation and expansion of PP-spheroids</section>Pancreatic progenitors generated from hPSCs (HuES4, H9, H1, SBAD3.1 and SBAD3.4) were dissociated at st4d8 of the Ameri protocol or St4d3 of the Rezania protocol using TrypLE Express Enzyme (Thermo Fisher) to generate a single cell suspension, and ran through a 50 µm cell strainer. A sample was taken to access the efficiency of differentiation by FACS. Cells were considered suitable for PP-spheroid formation if at least 60% of the cells were PDX1+. Prior to re-plating, the cells were washed with expansion medium (DMEM/F12 Glutamax, 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, 64 ng/ml FGF2 and B-27 supplement) and resuspended in a mixture of 3 parts GFR-Matrigel and 1 part expansion medium. The cells were plated at a density of 1000 cells/µl of Matrigel mixture in Nunc cell culture treated 4 well dishes (Thermo Fisher). The Matrigel cell suspension was dispensed slowly in the center of pre-warmed plates in order to form a 3D dome, and medium was added after Matrigel polymerization. The medium was changed every 3 days until passaging. The presence of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, while strictly required for passaging, was not required for all the cell lines throughout the entire culture time. However, in order to keep conditions as uniform as possible we chose to keep ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in the culture medium by default. After roughly 10 days in culture, PP-spheroids were dissociated with a dissociation solution containing 0.25% Trypsin (Thermo Fisher) and 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher) in 1x PBS, for 5-8 minutes. The single cells were strained as mentioned previously, quantified with the NucleoCounter NC-200, and re-plated. Cells were frozen in a solution of 50% expansion medium, 40% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma).<br><section>Generation and expansion of fetal spheres</section>Following fetal pancreas dissection and mesenchyme removal, the sample was digested with 250U/ml Collagenase Type IV (Thermo Fisher) for 10-20 minutes at 37°C, combined with mechanical dissociation every 5-10 minutes by pipetting, until only small clumps of tissue remained. The enzyme was inactivated with FBS and the cells were washed in expansion medium. Similar to the PP-spheroid preparation, cells were suspended in a mix of 3 parts GFR-Matrigel to 1 part expansion medium and plated in Nunc cell culture treated 4 well dishes. After 10-15 days, the fetal spheres were passaged by an identical procedure, except a shorter Collagenase Type IV incubation (5-10 minutes).<br><section>Single-cell RNA-sequencing and Analysis</section>Generation of single-cell transcriptomic profiling from PP-spheroids (HUES4, H1, SBAD3.4), 2D cell cultures (HUES4), fetal spheres, and fetal pancreas was done using the MARS-seq protocol as described in (Jaitin et al., 2014). Single cells were sorted using either the BD FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences) or the Sony SH800 (Sony). Successful library preparation was confirmed using the Fragment Analyser device (Agilent) with the DNA HS kit (Agilent). Libraries were sequenced using Illumina Next-seq 500. R1 and R2 fastq files were generated using bcl2fastq v2.19.1, the pooling and well information from the sequence was extracted into a unique fastq file using umis v1.0.3. The reads were then filtered based on the pooling barcodes with 1 mismatch allowed. The poly-Ts at the end of the sequences were trimmed using cutadapt v1.18 (Martin). Reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38 together with ERCC92) using hisat2 v2.1.0 (Kim et al., 2015), bam files generated, sorted and indexed with samtools v1.7 (Li et al., 2009), reads counted with featureCounts (subread v1.5.3) (Liao et al., 2014) using Ensembl version 93, and the umis using umi_tools v1.0.0 (Smith et al., 2017).SCATER v1.12.2 (McCarthy et al., 2017) was used to exclude low quality cells based on three QC covariates (count depth, genes per cell, and fraction of mitochondrial genes). An average of 2500 reads per cell, and 1500 genes per cell was obtained with this method. Cells were assigned into G1, G2/M or S phase using the cyclone function from Scran v1.12.1 (Scialdone et al., 2015).Further computational analysis was done using Seurat 3.0.3 (Stuart et al., 2019). Top 2000 variable genes were calculated using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) method and data integration was performed using pre-computed anchorsets in order to eliminate sequencing batch effects. After running PCA on the scaled integrated data, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction (McInnes et al., 2018) was run to visualize cells. Clusters of cells with similar expression patterns were determined by using the FindNeighbors() and FindClusters() functions in Seurat 3.0.3 (see scripts deposited on github for specific parameters). The FindAllMarkers() function in Seurat 3.0.3 was used in order to obtain lists of differentially expressed genes in defined populations across the dataset. Visualizations were generated using Seurat 3.0.3 and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016)."
