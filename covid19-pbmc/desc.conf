The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted
in excess morbidity and mortality as well as economic decline. To characterise
the systemic host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell
RNA-sequencing coupled with analysis of cell surface proteins, providing
molecular profiling of over 800,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a
cohort of 130 patients with COVID-19. Our cohort, from three UK centres, spans
the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease severities ranging from
asymptomatic to critical. Three control groups were included: healthy
volunteers, patients suffering from a non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illness
and healthy individuals administered with intravenous lipopolysaccharide to
model an acute inflammatory response. Full single cell transcriptomes coupled
with quantification of 188 cell surface proteins, and T and B lymphocyte
antigen receptor repertoires have provided several insights into COVID-19: 1. a
new non-classical monocyte state that sequesters platelets and replenishes the
alveolar macrophage pool; 2. platelet activation accompanied by early priming
towards megakaryopoiesis in immature haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and
expansion of megakaryocyte-primed progenitors; 3. increased clonally expanded
CD8+ effector:effector memory T cells, and proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
in patients with more severe disease; and 4. relative increase of IgA
plasmablasts in asymptomatic stages that switches to expansion of IgG
plasmablasts and plasma cells, accompanied with higher incidence of BCR
sharing, as disease severity increases. All data and analysis results are
available for interrogation and data mining through an intuitive web portal.
Together, these data detail the cellular processes present in peripheral blood
during an acute immune response to COVID-19, and serve as a template for
multi-omic single cell data integration across multiple centers to rapidly
build powerful resources to help combat diseases such as COVID-19.
