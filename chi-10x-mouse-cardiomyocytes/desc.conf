Abstract from <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318943"
target="_blank">Zhang et al</a>:
<p>
<b>Rationale:</b>
<p>
Extraembryonic tissues, including the yolk sac and placenta, and the heart
within the embryo, work to provide crucial nutrients to the embryo. The
association of congenital heart defects with extraembryonic tissue defects
further supports the potential developmental relationship between the heart and
extraembryonic tissues. Although the development of early cardiac lineages has
been well-studied, the developmental relationship between cardiac lineages,
including epicardium, and extraembryonic mesoderm remains to be defined.

<p>
<b>Objective:</b>
<p>
To explore the developmental relationships between cardiac and extraembryonic lineages.

<p>
<b>Methods and Results:</b>
<p>
Through high-resolution single-cell and genetic lineage/clonal analyses, we
show an unsuspected clonal relationship between extraembryonic mesoderm and
cardiac lineages. Single-cell transcriptomics and trajectory analyses uncovered
2 mesodermal progenitor sources contributing to left ventricular
cardiomyocytes, 1 embryonic and the other with an extraembryonic gene
expression signature. Additional lineage-tracing studies revealed that the
extraembryonic-related progenitors reside at the embryonic/extraembryonic
interface in gastrulating embryos and produce distinct cell types forming the
pericardium, septum transversum, epicardium, dorsolateral regions of the left
ventricle and atrioventricular canal myocardium, and extraembryonic mesoderm.
Clonal analyses demonstrated that these progenitors are multipotent, giving
rise to not only cardiomyocytes and serosal mesothelial cell types but also,
remarkably, extraembryonic mesoderm.

<p>
<b>Conclusions:</b>
<p>
Overall, our results reveal the location of previously unknown multipotent
cardiovascular progenitors at the embryonic/extraembryonic interface and define
the earliest embryonic origins of serosal mesothelial lineages, including the
epicardium, which contributes fibroblasts and vascular support cells to the
heart. The shared lineage relationship between embryonic cardiovascular
lineages and extraembryonic mesoderm revealed by our studies underscores an
underappreciated blurring of boundaries between embryonic and extraembryonic
mesoderm. Our findings suggest unexpected underpinnings of the association
between congenital heart disease and placental insufficiency anomalies and the
potential utility of extraembryonic cells for generating cardiovascular cell
types for heart repair.
