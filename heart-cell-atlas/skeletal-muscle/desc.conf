<section>Acquisition of skeletal muscle tissue</section>
<p>
Intercostal muscle samples were obtained from between the second and third rib
on the left side. This is typically from the deepest layer of muscle (furthest
away from the skin). Samples were collected directly into the cold preservation
solution.

<section>Skeletal muscle characterization</section>
<p>
We collected intercostal skeletal muscle samples from five healthy individuals,
including one donor with matched cardiac tissue, and profiled the transcriptome
of 35,665 single cells and 39,597 single nuclei. Analogous to the heart, the
combination of cells and nuclei allowed us to capture and resolve major cell
lineages, including cardiomyocyte, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth
muscle cells, pericytes, myeloid and lymphoid immune cells and satellite cells
(Extended Data Fig. 11a, b, Supplementary Table 31).
<p>
Further analysis of the vascular cells of the skeletal muscle identified ten
distinct populations. The endothelial cells showed five clusters separated
based on their respective vascular beds with signatures similar to the ones we
observe in the heart. The EC_cap expresses VWF and RGCC. Venous EC_ven express
ACKR1 and PLVAP, whereas arterial EC_art show SEMA3G and HEY1, in line with our
heart data (Extended Data Fig. 11c, d, Supplementary Table 32).
<p>
The overall distributions of vascular and stromal cell populations in skeletal
and cardiac muscle were similar, including the arterial and venous features of
ECs; however; skeletal muscle contained a single SMC cluster, potentially
related to the smaller size of the dataset. In skeletal muscle, the predicted
cell–cell interactions of the EC_art and SMCs included NOTCH1/4–JAG1 as well as
JAG1/JAG2/DLL4–NOTCH3, but not JAG1/JAG2/DLL4–NOTCH2, inferred in the heart
(Extended Data Fig. 11e, f, Supplementary Table 33).
