Cerebellar development and function require precise regulation of molecular and
cellular programs to coordinate motor functions and integrate network signals
required for cognition and emotional regulation. However, molecular
understanding of human cerebellar development is limited. Here, we combined
spatially resolved and single-cell transcriptomics to systematically map the
molecular, cellular, and spatial composition of early and mid-gestational human
cerebellum. This enabled us to transcriptionally profile major cell types and
examine the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and lineages across
development. The resulting ‘Developmental Cell Atlas of the Human Cerebellum’
demonstrates that the molecular organization of the cerebellar anlage reflects
cytoarchitecturally distinct regions and developmentally transient cell types
that are insufficiently captured in bulk transcriptional profiles. By mapping
disease genes onto cell types, we implicate the dysregulation of specific
cerebellar cell types, especially Purkinje cells, in pediatric and adult
neurological disorders. These data provide a critical resource for
understanding human cerebellar development with implications for the cellular
basis of cerebellar diseases.

<section>Cerebellum samples</section>
<p>
Specimens from fetal (9-22 PCW) human cerebellum were obtained from the Birth
Defects Research Laboratory at the University of Washington or the Human
Developmental Biology Resource55 with ethics board approval and maternal
written consent. This study was performed in accordance with ethical and legal
guidelines of the Seattle Children’s Hospital institutional review board.

<section>snRNA-seq analysis</section>
<p>
Deep and shallow sequencing runs from experiment l,23 and shallow sequencing
runs from experiment 2 and experiment 3 were filtered independently (datasets
IK, 5K, 10K, and 80K, respectively). Cells with <200 genes, >4 standard
deviations above the median number of genes or UMIs, or >1-5% mitochondrial
genes were removed from the analysis (Supplementary Table 7). DoubletFinder22
was used to detect likely doublets assuming a rate of 5%, that were discarded
from analysis. Sample sex was confirmed by counting reads mapped to the
female-specific non-coding RNA XIST and the chromosome Y specific gene DDX3Y.
We used Seurat24 v3 for downstream analysis. The four filtered datasets (IK,
5K, 10K, and 80K) were combined into a single dataset using canonical
correlation analysis with anchors (‘FindlntegrationAnchors’) to correct for
batch effects.61 The top 2,000 most variable genes were used to find individual
cells in each sequencing run that originate from the same biological state,
which became the anchors to merge runs together. The resulting dataset was then
scaled and centered as well as regressed out cell cycle difference (S.score –
G2M.score). Data dimensionality of the integrated dataset was reduced by
principal component analysis (‘RunPCA’), then uniform manifold approximation
and projection (‘RunUMAP’), then Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graph
construction (‘FindNeighbors’), and finally Louvain clustering (‘FindClusters’)
using the first 75 principal components and a resolution of 1.5 to determine
cluster assignment. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to identify
differentially expressed genes for each cluster (‘FindAIIMarkers’) and compare
them to known gene markers for cell type assignment. One cluster with no
significant differentially expressed genes and another cluster with an
enrichment of mitochondrial genes were removed.
<p>
Subcluster analysis was performed by subsetting populations of interest from
the overall dataset. Clustering and differential gene tests were repeated with
a subpopulation specific number of principal components determined by
‘ElbowPlot’. Then, pseudotime analysis was performed using Monocle 3.28 Subsets
were normalized (‘preprocess_cds’), dimension reduction was applied
(‘reduce_dimension’), followed by clustering (‘cluster_cells’) and
visualization (‘learn_graph’). Pseudotemporal ordering of cells was performed
(‘order_cells’) by selecting a biologically relevant starting point. Genes of
interest were used to construct the pseudotime trajectory
(‘plot_genes_in_pseudotime’).
