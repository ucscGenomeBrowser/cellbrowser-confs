The mammalian brain develops through a complex interplay of spatial cues
generated by diffusible morphogens, cell-cell interactions, and intrinsic
genetic programs that result in the generation of likely more than a thousand
distinct cell types. Therefore, a complete understanding of mammalian brain
development requires systematic mapping of cell states covering the entire
relevant spatiotemporal range. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell
transcriptome atlas of mouse brain development spanning from gastrulation to
birth. We identified almost a thousand distinct cellular states, including the
initial emergence of the neuroepithelium, a rich set of region-specific
secondary organizers and a complete developmental program for the functional
elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes. We used the atlas to
directly test the hypothesis that human glioblastoma reflects a return to a
developmental cell state. In agreement, most aneuploid tumor cells matched
embryonic rather than adult types, while karyotypically normal cells
predominantly matched adult immune cell types.

<section>Single-cell RNA sequencing</section>
<p>
Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing was performed using the 10x Genomics
Chromium Single Cell Kit v1. Single-cell suspensions concentrated at 500-700
cells/ml were mixed with master mix and nuclease free water according to the
Chromium manual, targeting 3500 cells per reaction. 12 PCR cycles were used for
cDNA synthesis. Each library was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq instrument,
one sample per lane, with one 98 bp read located near the 3′ end of the mRNA.
Illumina runs were demultiplexed and aligned to the genome (mm10-3.0.0), and
BAM files were obtained from the 10X Genomics cellranger pipeline (version
3.0.2). Molecule counts were attributed to spliced and unspliced transcripts by
running velocyto (version 0.17.11) with standard parameters, resulting in one
loom file (http://loompy.org) per sample.

<section>tSNE of all cells and dendrogram of all clusters</section>
<p>
We computed HPF to 30 components and then used the Art of tSNE heuristics
(but with exaggeration=1.5, perplexity=150) to obtain the tSNE layout in Figure
1. The use of a relatively small number of HPF components resulted in a
globally smoother and more connected manifold, at the expense of reduced local
resolution. This tSNE was used for visualization only; clustering and
annotation was performed as described above.

<p>
The final dendrogram was generated by running Cytograph’s Aggregator class on
942 clusters with parameter mask set to [‘cellcycle’, ‘sex’, ‘ieg’, ‘mt’],
which excludes cell-cycle, sex-related, immediate-early, and mitochondrial
genes from the analysis. Both the cluster dendrogram and the tSNE of all cells
were computed with a more recent version of cytograph (commit
8a5518e-81197f5aa9d54565cbce3875738d8dac9).
