abstract = """
Subretinal transplantation of human retinal organoid-derived cells can
potentially restore vision lost in photoreceptor dystrophies. Prior studies
analyzed the maturation, integration, and function of transplanted organoid
cells in the subretinal region, but detailed molecular analysis of transplanted
photoreceptor and of cells that migrate to other retinal layers has not been
conducted. Here, we characterized migratory and non-migratory organoid-derived
cells following subretinal transplantation into a dystrophic host. Retinal
organoids derived from Crx-tdTomato+ H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (aged
D134) were transplanted into immunodeficient Rd1/NS mice. Graft-derived cells
using single-cell RNA sequencing and histological analysis were analyzed 4.5
months later.  Age-matched human retinal organoids maintained in vitro served
as controls. Graft-derived cells migrated to all retinal layers, and underwent
long-distance tangential migration.  Transcriptomic analysis of transplanted
cells identified two cell types not found in cultured controls – PAX2-positive
retinal astrocytes, and ARX/NKX2-2/HOXC8-positive brain/spinal cord-like neural
precursors.  Some migrating cells were proliferative, but overall less
proliferation was observed in the transplants than the cultured organoids.
Transplanted rod and cone photoreceptors remained in the subretinal space, and
were more mature than age-matched photoreceptors in cultured organoids. This
study shows that extrinsic signals present in the degenerative subretinal space
promote maturation of photoreceptors in transplanted retinal organoids, while
also inducing formation of migratory cell populations that are not normally
derived from retinal progenitors, either in cultured organoids or in vivo.
This has important implications for the design and safety of cell-based
therapies for treating photoreceptor dystrophies.

methods = """
scRNA-Seq was performed on dissociated cultured human retinal organoid cells or
transplanted human retinal organoid cells using the Chromium platform (10X
Genomics). Briefly, retinal organoid cells were dissociated into a single cell
suspension using the Papain Dissociation System (Worthington) for 60 minutes at
37°C with gentle mixing every 5 minutes before stopping the reaction using
ovomucoid protease inhibitors. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in
ice-cold PBS containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5 U/μl RNase
inhibitor and were filtered through a 40-μm Flowmi cell strainer (Bel-Art SP).
Cell counts and viability was assessed by Trypan blue staining before loading
6000 cells on a Chromium Single Cell system using Next GEM 3’ reagent v3.1
kits. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 with ~50,000
reads per cell. The Cell Ranger 4 (10X Genomics) pipeline was used to process
the raw sequencing reads for demultiplexing, alignment to the GRCh38 human
reference genome and generating the cell-by-gene count matrix for downstream
analysis. The generated cell-by-gene count matrices were analyzed using the
Seurat ver3 R package. We filtered out cells that had UMIs less than 300 or
greater than 50000 and with a mitochondrial fraction of greater than 20%.
Doublets were identified and removed using the DoubletFinder R package.
Log-normalization, scaling, PCA and UMAP dimensional reduction and clustering
were performed using the standard Seurat pipeline. Major retinal cell types
were classified using previously identified cell type markers. Enriched genes
from the brain/spinal-like cell cluster were compared to the ASCOT gene
expression summaries of public RNA-Seq data to determine its classification.
