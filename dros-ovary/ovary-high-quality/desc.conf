<section>Selecting for high-quality cells using biological markers</section>
<p>
In a single-cell data set, cells expressing markers for 2 or more cell types
either indicates an intermediary cell state or the retention of doublets.
Doublet signal can arise through the capture of ambient RNA in the cell
suspension during library preparation along with a valid cell within a droplet
or from the simultaneous capture of the fragments from 2 distinct cell types.
This is a common challenge of droplet-based microfluidic library preparation
methods. It is crucial to minimize these contaminant signals because they
decrease the precision of clustering and the fidelity of downstream analyses
like pseudotemporal trajectory analysis. Although these can be removed
using a number of in silico approaches, the reliability of these tools depends
on the various assumptions that may or may not hold true in every biological
context. Therefore, we employed a biologically informed method instead.
<p>
The Drosophila ovary has been intensely studied for decades, leading to the
identification and establishment of reliable cell type–and cell stage–specific
expression patterns. Using this information we selected
high-quality cells, based on a cutoff criteria of > log2 fold expression of
conflicting cell-type markers in a number of distantly related cell types, for
our downstream analysis (S4 File).
<p>
To ensure that we have not removed true cell types and/or intermediary cell
states, we aligned this marker-cleaned data set with the original data set
using CCA (S2 Fig). The 2 data sets did not lose correlation because of this
cleanup process and were highly aligned, while the correlation vector with the
highest correlation strength (CC1) displayed an increased dispersion across
data set for the high-quality cells (compared to the original data set), thus
indicating an increase in resolution of cell types. Indeed, the number of
highly variable genes (limits: > 0.4 dispersion; > 0.01 and < 3 average
expression) that were used for PCA, increased from 897 in the original data set
to 1,075 in the high-quality data set. We also examined the expression of
markers used in the cleanup process, in both original and high-quality data set
and have shown the retention of all major cell types and signals less than
log2FC expression (S2 Fig). Finally, the consistency between derived and
expected observations of developmental trajectories provided additional
validation of the quality of the cells selected for the making of this data
set. The final data set of 7,053 high-quality cells and 11,782 genes was used
for downstream analysis.
