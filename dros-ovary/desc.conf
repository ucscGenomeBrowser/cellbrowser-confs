Oogenesis is a complex developmental process that involves spatiotemporally
regulated coordination between the germline and supporting, somatic cell
populations. This process has been modeled extensively using the Drosophila
ovary. Although different ovarian cell types have been identified through
traditional means, the large-scale expression profiles underlying each cell
type remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we have built
a transcriptomic data set for the adult Drosophila ovary and connected tissues.
Using this data set, we identified the transcriptional trajectory of the entire
follicle-cell population over the course of their development from stem cells
to the oogenesis-to-ovulation transition. We further identify expression
patterns during essential developmental events that take place in somatic and
germline cell types such as differentiation, cell-cycle switching, migration,
symmetry breaking, nurse-cell engulfment, egg-shell formation, and corpus
luteum signaling. Extensive experimental validation of unique expression
patterns in both ovarian and nearby, nonovarian cells also led to the
identification of many new cell type-and stage-specific markers. The inclusion
of several nearby tissue types in this data set also led to our identification
of functional convergence in expression between distantly related cell types
such as the immune-related genes that were similarly expressed in immune cells
(hemocytes) and ovarian somatic cells (stretched cells) during their brief
phagocytic role in nurse-cell engulfment. Taken together, these findings
provide new insight into the temporal regulation of genes in a cell-type
specific manner during oogenesis and begin to reveal the relatedness in
expression between cell and tissues types.

<section>Preprocessing chromium scRNA-seq output</section>
<p>
We processed the raw sequencing reads from each of the 10X Genomics Chromium
single-cell 3' RNA-seq libraries using Cell Ranger (version 3.0.0), the
recommended analysis pipeline from the Chromium single-cell gene expression
software suite. The reference index for Cell Ranger was built using the
Drosophila melanogaster Release 6 reference genome assembly [28] made available
on the Ensembl genome database. The cellranger count pipeline for alignment,
filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting was used to generate the
multidimensional feature-barcode matrix for each replicate.

<section>Batch effect correction using canonical correlation analysis</section
<p>
The 2 replicate data sets were then compared using canonical correlation
analysis (CCA) to test for variation between the data sets caused by batch
effects. Replicate 1 and 2 were aligned using 2,926 genes with the highest
dispersion in both data sets, and 75 correlation vectors were used for
downstream clustering. Each of the 28 clusters were comparable to the clusters
in Fig 1, and a strong correlation was observed between replicate 1 and 2,
indicating no significant batch effects (S1 Fig). Replicate 1 displayed a
significant improvement in sampling of rarer cell types, compared to replicate
2, and was exclusively used for all downstream analyses (S1 Fig).

<section>UMAP clustering analysis</section>
<p>
Seurat was used for log-normalization and scaling of the data using default
parameters. The 1,075 highly variable genes were selected as input for PCA and
the first 75 PCs were selected to build the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph
for clustering. To assemble cells into transcriptomic clusters, graph-based
clustering method using the SLM algorithm [50] was performed in Seurat. We
chose to plot clusters on a UMAP because this dimensionality reduction
technique arranges cells in a developmental time-course in a meaningful
continuum of clusters along a trajectory [51]. A number of resolution
parameters, ranging from 0.5 to 6 were tested which resulted in 14 to 46
clusters. The relationship between clusters in each resolution was assessed
using the R package clustree [52], based off of which a resolution of 6 was
selected to obtain an initial number of 46 clusters (S2 Fig). Differentially
expressed markers specific to each cluster were identified using the function
FindAllMarkers (S3 File), and clusters with no unique markers were merged with
their nearest neighbor after careful consideration of the differences in
average expression pattern in each cluster. The final number of clusters was
decided based on the uniqueness of observed and expected gene markers and the
relative relationships with other clusters (S2 Fig). Cell-type identities were
then assigned to each cluster using known (S1 File) and experimentally
validated markers.
