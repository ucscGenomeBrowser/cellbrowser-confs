<section>Unsupervised reclustering of cell subsets using Monocle (v2)</section>
<p>
Smaller subsets of cells from the entire data set were selected using the
SubsetData function in Seurat. These subsets were reclustered and imported into
Monocle (v2) for further downstream analysis using the importCDS()
function, with the parameter import_all set to TRUE to retain cell-type
identity in Seurat for each cell. The raw UMI counts for these subsetted data
sets were assumed to be distributed according to a negative binomial
distribution and were normalized as recommended by the Monocle (v2) pipeline.
The number of dimensions used to perform dimensionality reduction was chosen
using the Elbow method (S3 Fig). The cells were clustered in an unsupervised
manner using the density peak algorithm in which the number of clusters was set
for an expected number of cell types (as in for early follicle-cell
differentiation states) or cell states (as in mitotic-endocycle transition
state, along with mitotic and endocycling follicle cells). The number of cell
clusters, in case of the “germline cells” subset and the “oviduct cells” and
“muscle cells” subset was chosen in an unsupervised manner based on significant
rho (local density) and delta (distance of current cell to another cell of
higher density) threshold values.

<section>Pseudotime inference analysis and identification of lineage-specific
genes of interest</section>
<p>
Pseudotime inference analysis on known cell differentiation programs of
oogenesis was performed using Monocle (v2). Cells were ordered in an
unsupervised manner on a pseudotemporal vector based on genes that are
differentially expressed over pseudotime between cell-type identities assigned
in Seurat or cell states identified as clusters in Monocle, depending on the
clustering as mentioned in the previous section. Lowly expressed aberrant genes
were removed from the ordering genes. Multiple trajectories were generated by
ordering the cells using different numbers of statistically significant (q &lt;
0.05) genes that are expressed in a minimum number of predetermined cells, and
the efficacy of the trajectories was tested with validated marker gene
expression. The trajectory that reflected the most accurate cell state changes
was then selected for downstream analysis. To assess transcriptional changes
across a branching event, as seen in the early somatic and the polar/stalk
trajectories, the function BEAM was used to analyze binary decisions of cell
differentiation processes across a branch.
