How the rich variety of neurons in the nervous system arises from neural stem
cells is not well understood. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing and in vivo
confirmation, we uncover previously unrecognized neural stem and progenitor
cell diversity within the fetal mouse and human neocortex, including multiple
types of radial glia and intermediate progenitors. We also observed that
transcriptional priming underlies the diversification of a subset of
ventricular radial glial cells in both species; genetic fate mapping confirms
that the primed radial glial cells generate specific types of basal progenitors
and neurons. The different precursor lineages therefore diversify streams of
cell production in the developing murine and human neocortex. These data show
that transcriptional priming is likely a conserved mechanism of mammalian
neural precursor lineage specialization.

<section>Dimension reduction and clustering</section>
<p>
We used PCA and t-distributed SNE (19) as our main dimension reduction
approaches. PCA was performed with RunPCA function (Seurat) using HVGs.
Following PCA, we conducted JACKSTRAW analysis with 100 iterations to identify
statistically significant (P < 0.01) PCs that were driving systematic
variation. We used t-SNE to present data in 2D coordinates, generated by
RunTSNE function in Seurat. Significant PCs identified by JACKSTRAW analysis
were used as input. Perplexity was set to 30. t-SNE plots were generated using
R package ggplot2 (39). Clustering was done with the Luvain-Jaccard algorithm
using t-SNE coordinates by FindClusters function from Seurat with default
setting.
