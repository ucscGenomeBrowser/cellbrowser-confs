Cigarette smoke first interacts with the lung through the cellularly diverse
airway epithelium and goes on to drive development of most chronic lung
diseases. Here, through single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of the tracheal
epithelium from smokers and non-smokers, we generate a comprehensive atlas of
epithelial cell types and states, connect these into lineages, and define
cell-specific responses to smoking. Our analysis infers multi-state lineages
that develop into surface mucus secretory and ciliated cells and then contrasts
these to the unique specification of submucosal gland (SMG) cells. Accompanying
knockout studies reveal that tuft-like cells are the likely progenitor of both
pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and CFTR-rich ionocytes. Our smoking analysis
finds that all cell types, including protected stem and SMG populations, are
affected by smoking through both pan-epithelial smoking response networks and
hundreds of cell-specific response genes, redefining the penetrance and
cellular specificity of smoking effects on the human airway epithelium.

<section>Processing and analysis</section>
<p>
Initial pre-processing of the 10× in vivo scRNA-seq data, including
demultiplexing, alignment to the hg38 human genome, and UMI-based gene
expression quantification, was performed using Cell Ranger (version 3.0, 10×
Genomics).
<p>
We used single-cell integration
implemented in Seurat v3, which identifies mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) cells
across pairwise donors to use as “anchors” by which a batch correction can be
calculated and then applied in order to bring expression across datasets into a
common subspace. We carried out the integration analysis using the top 30
dimensions from a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based on SCTransform
normalized expression of the top 3000 most informative genes across donor
datasets, where “informativeness” was defined by gene dispersion (i.e., the log
of the ratio of expression variance to its mean) across cells, calculated after
accounting for its relationship with mean expression (using the
SelectIntegrationFeatures function). With integrated expression values in hand,
we carried out principle component analysis (PCA) and then clustered and
visualized the integrated data using the top 30 dimensions. For visualization,
we reduced variation to two dimensions using Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP; n.neighbors = 10, min.dist = 0.35). Furthermore, we carried
out unsupervised clustering by constructing a shared nearest neighbor (SNN)
graph based on k-nearest neighbors (k = 20) and then determining the number and
composition of clusters using a modularity function optimizer based on the
Louvain algorithm (resolution = 0.22).
