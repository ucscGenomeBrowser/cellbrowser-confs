<p>
<b>Rationale</b>: Macrophages are the most abundant immune cell in the alveoli
and small airways, and are traditionally viewed as a homogeneous population
during health. Whether distinct subsets of airspace macrophages are present in
healthy humans is unknown. Single cell RNA sequencing allows for examination of
transcriptional heterogeneity between cells and between individuals.
Understanding the conserved repertoire of airspace macrophages during health is
essential to understanding cellular programing during disease.

<p>
<b>Objective</b>: We sought to determine the transcriptional heterogeneity of
human cells obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage of healthy adults.

<p>
<b>Methods</b>: Ten subjects underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar
lavage. Cells from lavage were subjected to single cell RNA sequencing. Unique
cell populations and putative functions were identified. Transcriptional
profiles were compared across individuals.

<p>
<b>Measurements and main results</b>: We identify two novel subgroups of
resident airspace macrophages - defined by pro-inflammatory and metallothionein
gene expression profiles. We define subsets of monocyte-like cells and compare
them to peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Finally, we compare global
macrophage and monocyte programing between males and females.

<p>
<b>Conclusions</b>: Healthy human airspaces contain multiple populations of
myeloid cells that are highly conserved between individuals and between sexes.
Resident macrophages comprise the largest population and include novel subsets
defined by inflammatory and metal-binding profiles. Monocyte-like cells within
the airspaces are transcriptionally aligned with circulating blood cells and
include a rare population defined by expression of cell-matrix interaction
genes. This study is the first to delineate the conserved heterogeneity of
airspace immune cells during health and identifies two previously unrecognized
macrophage subsets.

<section>Pre-processing and quality control</section>
<p>
Initial pre-processing of the 10 subjects’ scRNA-seq data, including
demultiplexing, alignment to the hg38 human genome, and UMI-based gene
expression quantification, was performed using Cell Ranger (version 3.0, 10x
Genomics). To ensure high quality single cells were used for downstream
analysis, we filtered out cells with low numbers of genes (bottom 2% of each
sample) or with greater than 40% of mapped reads originating from the
mitochondrial genome. Although observations comprising multiple cells were
removed during the cell selection stage, we additionally safeguarded against
doublets by removing all cells with a UMI count greater than the 98th
percentile of UMI counts for each sample. Prior to downstream analysis, select
mitochondrial and ribosomal genes (genes beginning with MT-, MRPL, MRPS, RPL,
or RPS) were removed. The final quality-controlled dataset consisted of 49,384
cells and 18,004 genes.
<p>
To account for differences in coverage across cells, we normalized and variance
stabilized UMI counts for each subject using the SCTransform method (1) in the
Seurat R package (2, 3). In addition to adjusting for sequencing depth, we also
adjusted for the proportion of mitochondrial reads.

<section>Data integration, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization</section>
<p>
Data from the 10 subjects were combined using single cell integration
implemented in Seurat v3, which identifies mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) cells
across pairwise subjects to use as “anchors” to perform batch correction.
Integration was carried out using the top 30 dimensions from a canonical
correlation analysis (CCA) based on SCTransform- normalized expression of the
top 3,000 most informative genes, defined by gene dispersion using Seurat’s
SelectIntegrationFeatures function. Integrated data were then clustered and
visualized using the top 20 principal components (PCs). For visualization, we
reduced variation to two dimensions using Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection(4) (UMAP; n.neighbors = 50, min.dist = 0.3). Unsupervised clustering
was performed using a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph based on 20-nearest
neighbors and then determining the number and composition of clusters using a
smart local moving (SLM) algorithm (resolution = 0.2). This algorithm
identified 13 clusters.
