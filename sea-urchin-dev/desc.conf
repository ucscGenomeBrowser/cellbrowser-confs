Identifying cell states during development from their mRNA profiles provides
insight into their gene regulatory network. Here, we leverage the sea urchin
embryo for its well-established gene regulatory network to interrogate the
embryo using single cell RNA sequencing. We tested eight developmental stages
in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, from the eight-cell stage to late in
gastrulation. We used these datasets to parse out 22 major cell states of the
embryo, focusing on key transition stages for cell type specification of each
germ layer. Subclustering of these major embryonic domains revealed over 50
cell states with distinct transcript profiles. Furthermore, we identified the
transcript profile of two cell states expressing germ cell factors, one we
conclude represents the primordial germ cells and the other state is
transiently present during gastrulation. We hypothesize that these cells of the
Veg2 tier of the early embryo represent a lineage that converts to the germ
line when the primordial germ cells are deleted. This broad resource will
hopefully enable the community to identify other cell states and genes of
interest to expose the underpinning of developmental mechanisms.

<p>
Single cell encapsulation was performed using the Chromium Single Cell Chip B
kit on the 10× Genomics Chromium Controller. Single cell cDNA and libraries
were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3 Chemistry.
Libraries were sequenced by Genewiz on the Illumina Hiseq (2×150 bp paired-end
runs). Single cell unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting (counting of
unique barcodes given to individual transcript molecules), was performed using
Cell Ranger Single Cell Software Suite 3.0.2 from 10× Genomics. The custom
transcriptome reference was generated from assembly Spur-4.2 using CellRanger.
Duplicate blastula and gastrula stage libraries were aggregated using the
CellRanger aggr function. CellRanger gene expression matrices were further
analyzed using the R package Seurat v 3.1.4 (Butler et al., 2018; Stuart et
al., 2019). Cells of 8-cell to early blastula stage with at least 1500 and at
most 7000 genes (features), and cells with at least 400 and at most 2500 genes
in hatched blastula to late gastrula stage were included in downstream
analysis. Individual datasets were normalized by scaling gene expression in
each cell by total gene expression and then log transformed.  The t-SNE
(t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding is a machine learning algorithm
for visualizations) projection and clustering analysis for visualization of the
integrated data was conducted using 15 parameter dimensions and resolution of
0.5.
