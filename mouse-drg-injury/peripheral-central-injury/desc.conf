After an injury in the adult mammalian central nervous system, lesioned axons fail to
regenerate. This failure to regenerate contrasts with the remarkable potential of axons to grow
following an injury in the peripheral nervous system. Peripheral sensory neurons with cell soma
in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) switch to a regenerative state after nerve injury to enable axon
regeneration and functional recovery. Decades of research have focused on the signaling
pathways elicited by injury in sensory neurons and in Schwann cells that insulate axons as
central mechanisms regulating nerve repair. However, neuronal microenvironment is far more
complex and is composed of multiple cell types including endothelial, immune and glial cells.
Whether the microenvironment surrounding neuronal soma contribute to the poor
regenerative outcomes following central injuries remains largely unexplored. To answer this
question, we performed a single cell transcriptional profiling of the DRG neuronal
microenvironment response to peripheral and central injuries. In dissecting the roles of the
microenvironment contribution, we have focused on a poorly studied glia population of
Satellite Glial Cells (SGC) surrounding the neuronal cell soma. Upon a peripheral injury, SGC
contribute to axon regeneration via Fatty acid synthase (Fasn)-PPARα signaling pathway. Our
analysis reveals that in response to central injuries, SGC do not activate the PPAR signaling
pathway. However, induction of this pathway with fenofibrate, an FDA- approved PPARα
agonist used for dyslipidemia treatment, rescued axon regeneration following an injury to the
central nerves. Collectively, our results uncovered a previously unappreciated role of the
neuronal microenvironment differential response in central and peripheral injuries.

<p> 
3 days post sciatic nerve crush injury (SNC), dorsal root crush injury (DRC) or spinal cord injury
(SCI)
<section>Extract protocol</section>
<p>
Whole DRG’s were dissociated with enzyme mix (Papain, Collagenase) to a single cell
suspension, washed in 1X PBS+0.2%BSA solution, passed through a 40-micron cell strainer and
FACS sorted using live/dead staining. Sorted cells were loaded on the 10X Chromium system. 
Library construction protocol 
Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using GemCode Single-Cell 3′ Gel Bead and Library
Kit (10x Genomics).  
<section>Data Processing</section>
<p>
A digital expression matrix was obtained using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (Build
version 3.0.0).  Quantification and statistical analysis were done with Partek Flow package
(Build version 9.0.20.0417).
