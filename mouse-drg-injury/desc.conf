Peripheral sensory neurons with cell body in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) switch
to a regenerative state after nerve injury to enable axon regeneration and
functional recovery. Studies of nerve injury responses in sensory neurons have
revealed signaling and transcriptional mechanisms that increase their intrinsic
regenerative capacity. However, the extent to which satellite glial cells
(SGC), which completely surround the neuronal soma contribute to these
responses remains unexplored. Using single cell RNA-seq, we defined the
transcriptional profile of SGC in naïve and injured conditions and identified
Fabp7, also known as BLBP, as a novel marker of SGC. We report that nerve
injury elicits gene expression changes in SGC, which are mostly related to
lipid metabolism, specifically fatty acid synthesis and the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. Conditional deletion of Fatty
acid synthase (Fasn), the key enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis,
specifically in SGC, impairs axon regeneration. Treatment with fenofibrate, a
PPARa agonist, rescues the impaired regeneration, suggesting that PPRAa, which
belongs to a family of lipid regulated transcription factors, functions
downstream of fatty acid synthesis in SGC to promote axon regeneration. These
results unravel fatty acid synthesis in SGC as a fundamental novel mechanism
mediating axon regeneration in mature peripheral nerves.

<section>Treatment protocol</section>
<p>
3 days post sciatic nerve crush injury.

<section>Extract protocol</section>
<p>
Whole DRGs were dissociated with enzyme mix (Papain, Collagenase) to a single
cell suspension, washed in 1X PBS+0.2%BSA solution, passed through a 40-micron
cell strainer and FACS sorted using live/dead staining. Sorted cells were
loaded on the 10X Chromium system. 

<section>Library construction protocol</section>
<p>
Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using GemCode Single-Cell 3′ Gel
Bead and Library Kit (10x Genomics).

<section>Data Processing</section>
<p>
  digital expression matrix was obtained using the 10X Genomics
Cell Ranger pipeline (Build version 2.1.0).  Quantification and statistical
analysis were done with Partek Flow package (Build version 9.0.20.0417).
