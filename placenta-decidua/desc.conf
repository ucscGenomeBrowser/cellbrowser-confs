During early human pregnancy the uterine mucosa transforms into the decidua,
into which the fetal placenta implants and where placental trophoblast cells
intermingle and communicate with maternal cells. Trophoblast-decidual
interactions underlie common diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and
stillbirth. Here we profile the transcriptomes of about 70,000 single cells
from first-trimester placentas with matched maternal blood and decidual cells.
The cellular composition of human decidua reveals subsets of perivascular and
stromal cells that are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three
major subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive
immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository of
ligand-receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict the cell-type
specificity of cell-cell communication via these molecular interactions. Our
data identify many regulatory interactions that prevent harmful innate or
adaptive immune responses in this environment. Our single-cell atlas of the
maternal-fetal interface reveals the cellular organization of the decidua and
placenta, and the interactions that are critical for placentation and
reproductive success.

<section>Single cell RNA-seq data analysis</section>
<p>
Droplet-based sequencing data were aligned and quantified using the Cell Ranger
Single-Cell Software Suite (version 2.0, 10x Genomics) against the GRCh38 human
reference genome provided by Cell Ranger. Cells with fewer than 500 detected
genes and for which the total mitochondrial gene expression exceeded 20% were
removed. Mitochondrial genes and genes that were expressed in fewer than three
cells were also removed.
</p>
<p>
SmartSeq2 sequencing data were aligned with HISAT2, using the same genome
reference and annotation as the 10x Genomics data. Gene-specific read counts
were calculated using HTSeq-count. Cells with fewer than 1,000 detected genes
and more than 20% mitochondrial gene expression content were removed.
Furthermore, mitochondrial genes and genes expressed in fewer than three cells
were also removed. To remove batch effects due to background contamination of
cell free RNA, we also removed a set of genes that had a tendency to be
expressed in ambient RNA (PAEP, HBG1, HBA1, HBA2, HBM, AHSP and HBG2).
</p>
<p>
Downstream analyses—such as normalization, shared nearest neighbour graph-based
clustering, differential expression analysis and visualization—were performed
using the R package Seurat (version 2.3.3). Droplet-based and SmartSeq2 data
were integrated using canonical correlation analysis, implemented in the Seurat
alignment workflow. Cells, the expression profile of which could not be
well-explained by low-dimensional canonical correlation analysis compared to
low-dimensional principal component analysis, were discarded, as recommended by
the Seurat alignment tutorial. Clusters were identified using the community
identification algorithm as implemented in the Seurat ‘FindClusters’ function.
The shared nearest neighbour graph was constructed using between 5 and 40
canonical correlation vectors as determined by the dataset variability; the
resolution parameter to find the resulting number of clusters was tuned so that
it produced a number of clusters large enough to capture most of the biological
variability. UMAP analysis was performed using the RunUMAP function with
default parameters. Differential expression analysis was performed based on the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The P values were adjusted for multiple testing using
the Bonferroni correction. Clusters were annotated using canonical cell-type
markers. Two clusters of peripheral blood monocytes represented the same cell
type and were therefore merged.
</p>
<p>
We further removed contaminating cells: (i) maternal stromal cells that were
gathered in the placenta for one of the fetuses; (ii) a shared
decidual–placental cluster with fetal cells mainly present in two fetuses
(which we think is likely to be contaminating cells from other fetal tissues
due to the surgical procedure). This can occur owing to the source of the
tissue and the trauma of surgery. We also removed a cluster for which the top
markers were genes associated with dissociation-induced effects. Each of the
remaining clusters contained cells from multiple different fetuses, indicating
that the cell types and states we observed are not affected by batch effects.
</p>
<p>
We found further diversity within the T cell clusters, as well as the clusters
of endothelial, epithelial and perivascular cells, which we then reanalysed and
partitioned separately, using the same alignment and clustering procedure.
</p>
<p>
The trophoblast clusters (clusters 1, 9, 20, 13 and 16 from Fig. 1d) were taken
from the initial analysis of all cells and merged with the enriched EPCAM+ and
HLA-G+ cells. The droplet-based and Smart-seq2 datasets were integrated and
clustered using the same workflow as described above. Only cells that were
identified as trophoblast were considered for trajectory analysis.
</p>
<p>
Trajectory modelling and pseudotemporal ordering of cells was performed with
the monocle 2 R package (version 2.8.0). The most highly variable genes were
used for ordering the cells. To account for the cell-cycle heterogeneity in the
trophoblast subpopulations, we performed hierarchical clustering of the highly
variable genes and removed the set of genes that cluster with known cell-cycle
genes such as CDK1. Genes which changed along the identified trajectory were
identified by performing a likelihood ratio test using the function
differentialGeneTest in the monocle 2 package.
