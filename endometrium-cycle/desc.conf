>Wang et al</a>:<p>
In a human menstrual cycle the endometrium undergoes remodeling, shedding and
regeneration, all of which are driven by substantial gene expression changes in
the underlying cellular hierarchy. Despite its importance in human fertility
and regenerative biology, our understanding of this unique type of tissue
homeostasis remains rudimentary. We characterized the transcriptomic
transformation of human endometrium at single-cell resolution across the
menstrual cycle, resolving cellular heterogeneity in multiple dimensions. We
profiled the behavior of seven endometrial cell types, including a previously
uncharacterized ciliated cell type, during four major phases of endometrial
transformation, and found characteristic signatures for each cell type and
phase. We discovered that the human window of implantation opens with an abrupt
and discontinuous transcriptomic activation in the epithelia, accompanied with
a widespread decidualization feature in the stromal fibroblasts. Our study
provides a high-resolution molecular and cellular characterization of human
endometrial transformation across the menstrual cycle, providing insights into
this essential physiological process.</p>"""

<p>
Biopsies in the 10x dataset were obtained and dissociated following the
protocol used for the C1 dataset. Importantly, we collected both C1 and 10x
data for two biopsies, one each from the mid- and early-secretory phases
(Extended Data Fig. 1b). These served as anchors for a direct comparison
between the two datasets, and are referred to as anchor biopsies in this
manuscript. Following live cell enrichment via MACS (see description for the
Fluidigm C1 dataset), live cells were washed twice with PBS to remove ambient
RNA. The resulting epithelial and stromal portions were combined in a 1:1
concentration ratio and loaded onto the Chromium Next GEM Chip G
(10x Genomics) for each donor. GEM generation and barcoding, reverse
transcription, cDNA generation and library construction were performed
following the manufacturer's protocol (Single cell 3' reagent kit
v.3.1, 10x Genomics). Dual-indexed, single-cell libraries were pooled and
sequenced in paired-end reads on Novaseq (Illumina).

<p>Raw reads in the *.fastq files were aligned to reference (GRCh38-3.0.0) and
quantified using Cell Ranger (v.3.1.0) with -expect-cells=10,000. Downstream
data analysis was performed using the Seurat package (v.3.1.2)58 and scripts in
R. Raw counts (ct) were normalized to log-transformed transcripts per
million using the NormalizeData() function in Seurat.</p>
