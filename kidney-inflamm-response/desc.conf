Single cell genomics are revolutionizing our ability to characterize complex
tissues. By contrast, the techniques used to analyze the renal biopsy are
little changed over the past several decades. In this study we have tested the
hypothesis that single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) can comprehensively
describe cell types and states in a human kidney biopsy. We generated 8,746
single cell cell transcriptomes from a healthy adult kidney and a single kidney
transplant biopsy core by sc-RNA-seq. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the
biopsy identified 16 distinct cell types, including all of the major immune
cell types and most native kidney cell types in this biopsy whose histologic
read was mixed rejection. Endothelial cells formed three distinct sub-clusters:
resting cells and two activated endothelial cell clusters, including expression
of Fc-receptor pathway activation and immunoglobulin internalization genes,
consistent with the pathologic diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection.
Monocytes formed two sub-clusters representing a non-classical CD16+ group and
a classical CD16- group expressing dendritic cell maturation markers. The
presence of both monocyte cell subtypes was validated by staining of of
independent transplant biopsies. Comparison of healthy kidney epithelial
transcriptomes to their biopsy counterparts identified novel segment specific
pro-inflammatory responses. We mapped previously defined genes that associate
with rejection outcomes to single cell types and generated a searchable online
gene expression database. These findings represent a first step towards
incorporation of single cell transcriptomics into kidney biopsy interpretation,
describe a heterogeneous immune response in mixed rejection and provide a
searchable resource for the scientific community.
