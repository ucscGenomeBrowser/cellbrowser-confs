<p>
For snATAC-seq, nuclei were isolated with Nuclei EZ Lysis buffer (NUC-101;
Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitor (5892791001; Roche).
Samples were cut into < 2 mm pieces, homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer
(885302-0002; Kimble Chase) in 2 ml of ice-cold Nuclei EZ Lysis buffer, and
incubated on ice for 5 min with an additional 2 ml of lysis buffer. The
homogenate was filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer (43-50040-51;
pluriSelect) and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was
resuspended, washed with 4 ml of buffer, and incubated on ice for 5 min.
Following centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in Nuclei Buffer (10×
Genomics, PN-2000153), filtered through a 5-μm cell strainer (43-50005-03,
pluriSelect), and counted.</p>

Five snATAC-seq libraries were obtained using 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell
ATAC v1 chemistry following nuclear dissociation. A target of 10,000 nuclei
were loaded onto each lane. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq
instrument and counted with cellranger-atac v1.2 (10X Genomics) using GRCh38.
The read configuration for libraries 1–3 was 2 × 50 bp paired-end and the
configuration for libraries 4-5 was 2 × 150 bp paired-end. Sample index PCR was
performed at 12 cycles. Libraries were aggregated with cellranger-atac without
depth normalization. A mean of 318,097,692 reads were sequenced for each snATAC
library (s.d. = 54,357,210) corresponding to a mean of 12,946 fragments per
cell (s.d. = 2,960, Supplementary Table 5). The mean sequencing saturation for
snATAC libraries was 37.3 ± 2.2% and the mean fraction of reads with a valid
barcode was 97.3 ± 1.2% (Supplementary Table 7). Subsequently datasets were
processed with Seurat v3.0.2 and its companion package Signac v0.2.1
(https://github.com/timoast/signac) (21). Low-quality cells were removed from the
aggregated snATAC-seq library (peak region fragments > 2500, peak region
fragments < 25000, %reads in peaks > 15, blacklist ratio < 0.001, nucleosome
signal < 4 & mitochondrial gene ratio < 0.25) before normalization with
term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TFIDF). A fraction of reads in
peaks, number of reads in peaks per cell and ratio reads in genomic blacklist
region per cell for each patient were shown in Supplementary Fig. 19.
Dimensional reduction was performed via singular value decomposition (SVD) of
the TFIDF matrix and UMAP. A KNN graph was constructed to cluster cells with
the Louvain algorithm. Batch effect was corrected with Harmony (67) using the
“RunHarmony” function in Seurat. A gene activity matrix was constructed by
counting ATAC peaks within the gene body and 2 kb upstream of the
transcriptional start site using protein-coding genes annotated in the Ensembl
database. The gene activity matrix was log-normalized prior to label transfer
with the aggregated snRNA-seq Seurat object using canonical correlation
analysis. The aggregated snATAC-seq object was filtered using a 97% confidence
threshold for cell-type assignment following label transfer to remove
heterotypic doublets. The filtered snATAC-seq object was reprocessed with
TFIDF, SVD, and batch effect correction followed by clustering and annotation
based on lineage-specific gene activity. After filtering, there was a mean of
5408 ± 1393 nuclei per snATAC-seq library with a mean of 7538 ± 2938 peaks
detected per nucleus. The final snATAC-seq library contained a total of 214,890
unique peak regions among 27,034 nuclei and represented all major cell types
within the kidney cortex (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 20).
Differential chromatin accessibility between cell types was assessed with the
Signac FindMarkers function for peaks detected in at least 20% of cells using a
likelihood ratio test and a log-fold-change threshold of 0.25.
Bonferroni-adjusted p-values were used to determine significance at an
FDR < 0.05. Genomic regions containing snATAC-seq peaks were annotated with
ChIPSeeker (68) (v1.24.0) and clusterProfiler (69) (v3.16.1) using the UCSC
database (70) on hg38.</p>
