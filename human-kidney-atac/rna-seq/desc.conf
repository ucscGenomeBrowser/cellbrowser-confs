<section>Nuclear Dissociation and Library Preparation</section>
<p>
For snRNA-seq preparation, the RNase inhibitors (Promega, N2615 and Life
Technologies, AM2696) were added to the lysis buffer, and the pellet was
ultimately resuspended in nuclei suspension buffer (1× PBS, 1% bovine serum
albumin, 0.1% RNase inhibitor)65. 10X Chromium libraries were prepared
according to manufacturer protocol.<p>

<section>Single nucleus RNA sequencing bioinformatics workflow</section>
<p>
Five snRNA-seq libraries were obtained using 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 
5′ v2 chemistry following nuclear dissociation (65). Three snRNA-seq libraries
(patients 1-3) were prepared for a prior study GSE131882 (13). A target of 10,000
nuclei were loaded onto each lane. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina 
Novaseq instrument and counted with cellranger v3.1.0 using a custom pre-mRNA
GTF built on GRCh38 to include intronic reads. The read configuration for
libraries 1–3 was 2 × 100 bp and the configuration for libraries 4–5 was
2 × 150 bp paired-end. The cDNA for snRNA libraries was amplified for 17
cycles. Datasets were aggregated with cellranger v3.1.0 without depth
normalization. A mean of 377,573,305 reads (s.d. = 76,365,483) were sequenced 
for each snRNA library corresponding to a mean of 70,886 reads per cell
(s.d. = 8633, Supplementary Table 5). The mean sequencing saturation was
81.4 ± 2.4%. The mean fraction of reads with a valid barcode (fraction of reads
in cells) was 88.2 ± 5.9% (Supplementary Table 6). Subsequently datasets were
preprocessed with Seurat v3.0.2 (21) to remove low-quality nuclei (Features > 500,
Features < 4000, RNA count < 16000, %Mitochondrial genes < 0.8, %Ribosomal
protein large or small subunits < 0.4) and DoubletFinder v2.0.2 (66) to remove
heterotypic doublets (assuming 5% of barcodes represent doublets). The filtered
library was normalized with SCTransform, and corrected for batch effects with
Harmony v1.0 (67) using the “RunHarmony” function in Seurat. After filtering,
there was a mean of 3997 ± 930 cells per snRNA-seq library and a mean of
1674 ± 913 genes detected per nucleus. Number of genes per cell, number of UMIs
per cell and fraction of mitochondrial genes per cell for each patient were
shown in Supplementary Fig. 19. Clustering was performed by constructing a KNN
graph and applying the Louvain algorithm. Dimensional reduction was performed
with UMAP and individual clusters were annotated based on expression of
lineage-specific markers. The final snRNA-seq library contained 19,985 cells
and represented all major cell types within the kidney cortex (Supplementary
Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 20). Differential expression between cell types was
assessed with the Seurat FindMarkers function for transcripts detected in at
least 20% of cells using a log-fold-change threshold of 0.25.
Bonferroni-adjusted p-values were used to determine significance at an
FDR < 0.05.</p>
