<p>
Definitive haematopoiesis in the fetal liver supports self-renewal and
differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors
(HSC/MPPs) but remains poorly defined in humans. Here, using single-cell
transcriptome profiling of approximately 140,000 liver and 74,000 skin, kidney
and yolk sac cells, we identify the repertoire of human blood and immune cells
during development. We infer differentiation trajectories from HSC/MPPs and
evaluate the influence of the tissue microenvironment on blood and immune cell
development. We reveal physiological erythropoiesis in fetal skin and the
presence of mast cells, natural killer and innate lymphoid cell precursors in
the yolk sac. We demonstrate a shift in the haemopoietic composition of fetal
liver during gestation away from being predominantly erythroid, accompanied by
a parallel change in differentiation potential of HSC/MPPs, which we
functionally validate. Our integrated map of fetal liver haematopoiesis
provides a blueprint for the study of paediatric blood and immune disorders,
and a reference for harnessing the therapeutic potential of HSC/MPPs.

<section>Clustering and annotation</section>
<p>
Downstream analysis included data normalization (NormalizeData, LogNormalize
method, scaling factor 10,000), data feature scaling (ScaleData), variable gene
detection (FindVariableGenes), PCA (RunPCA, from variable genes) and Louvain
graph-based clustering (FindClusters, data dimensionality reduction using PCA,
clustering resolution (res.30)) performed using the R package Seurat (v.2.3.4).
Cluster cell identity was assigned by manual annotation using known marker
genes and computed DEGs using the FindAllMarkers function in the Seurat package
(one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, P values adjusted for multiple testing
using the Bonferroni correction; Supplementary Table 3). For computing DEGs,
all genes were probed provided they were expressed in at least 25% of cells in
either of the two populations compared and the expression difference on a
natural log scale was at least 0.25. Manual annotation was performed
iteratively, which included validating proposed cell labels with known markers
and further investigating clusters for which the gene signatures indicated
additional diversity. Numbers of each cell type per sample, annotations per
cell, and nGene and nUMI per cell type are reported in Supplementary Tables 4,
5, 8 and 9, respectively.
</p>
<p>
Clustering and cell type assignment for fetal liver data was assessed using two
additional clustering methods (not shown): agglomerative clustering (with Ward
linkage and Euclidean affinity) and Gaussian mixture (AgglomerativeClustering
class from the cluster module and GaussianMixture from the mixture module in
sklearn v.0.19.1 Python 3.6.3). Consensus agreement between the three
clustering methods was measured by Rand index and adjusted mutual information
implemented in the metrics module in the sklearn package. The Rand index scores
were 0.89 and 0.85 for agglomerative and Gaussian mixture clustering methods,
respectively.

<section>Dimensionality reduction and trajectory analysis</section>
<p>
Dimensionality reduction methods included t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE) (Seurat, computed from the first 20 PCs, Barnes–Hut fast
computation), UMAP (Python UMAP package, five nearest neighbours, correlation
metric, minimum distance 0.3, computed from the first 20 PCs), FDG (ForceAtlas2
class from fa2 Python Package, Barnes–Hut implementation for faster computation
with theta 0.8, 2,000 iterations) and PAGA (paga in scanpy Python package
v.1.2.2). Development trajectories were inferred by comparing FDG, PAGA and
diffusion-map plots. Inferred trajectory analysis included computing diffusion
map (scanpy tl.diffmap with 20 components), pseudotime (scanpy tl.dpt setting
the earliest known cell type as root) and variable genes across pseudotime. The
order of cells in pseudotime was statistically significant using Kruskal–Wallis
test (P < 1 × 10−7).
