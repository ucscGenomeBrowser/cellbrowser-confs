Understanding the function of genes and their regulation in tissue homeostasis
and disease requires knowing the cellular context in which genes are expressed
in tissues across the body. Single cell genomics allows the generation of
detailed cellular atlases in human tissues, but most efforts are focused on
single tissue types. Here, we establish a framework for profiling multiple
tissues across the human body at single-cell resolution using single nucleus
RNA-Seq (snRNA-seq), and apply it to 8 diverse, archived, frozen tissue types
(three donors per tissue). We apply four snRNA-seq methods to each of 25
samples from 16 donors, generating a cross-tissue atlas of 209,126 nuclei
profiles, and benchmark them vs. scRNA-seq of comparable fresh tissues. We use
a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to integrate an atlas across
tissues, donors, and laboratory methods. We highlight shared and
tissue-specific features of tissue-resident immune cells, identifying
tissue-restricted and non-restricted resident myeloid populations. These
include a cross-tissue conserved dichotomy between LYVE1- and HLA class
II-expressing macrophages, and the broad presence of LAM-like macrophages
across healthy tissues that is also observed in disease. For rare, monogenic
muscle diseases, we identify cell types that likely underlie the neuromuscular,
metabolic, and immune components of these diseases, and biological processes
involved in their pathology. For common complex diseases and traits analyzed by
GWAS, we identify the cell types and gene modules that potentially underlie
disease mechanisms. The experimental and analytical frameworks we describe will
enable the generation of large-scale studies of how cellular and molecular
processes vary across individuals and populations.

# methods: please describe roughly what the samples are and how you processed them computationally
methods = """
<section>Donor and sample characteristics</section>
<p>
All samples were selected from donors that were enrolled as part of the GTEx
project. As previously described (GTEx Consortium, 2020), all GTEx tissue
samples were derived from deceased donors, with study authorization obtained
via next-of-kin consent for the collection and banking of de-identified tissue
samples for scientific research.

<section>Sample processing</section>
<p>
Approximately 400mg of frozen tissue was obtained from each sample to allow the
application of multiple nucleus extraction methods. 20-50 mg of tissue was cut
per preparation. For donor pooling, ∼10-15 mg of tissue from each donor were
combined. Tissue remained frozen during cutting and weighing.
<p>
Each tissue sample was prepared as previously described for the EZ, CST, NST
and TST protocols (Drokhlyansky et al., 2020). Briefly, each tissue piece was
subjected to nucleus isolation and snRNA-Seq, using each of the four
conditions, with either commercial EZ buffer and mechanical breakdown using
dounsing (Habib et al) (EZ), or with nucleus isolation in salt-Tris buffer with
detergent, either NP-40, CHAPS, or Tween-20 (NST, CST and TST receptively),
with chopping to assist mechanical breakdown of the tissue (Drokhlyansky et
al., 2020).

<section>snRNA-seq library preparation and sequencing</section>
<p>
Nuclei were partitioned into Gel Beads in Emulsion (GEMs) using the GemCode
instrument. Lysis and barcoded reverse transcription of RNA occurred in GEMs,
followed by amplification, shearing and adaptor and sample index attachment
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics). Libraries were
sequenced on an Illumina Next-Seq 500 or Nova-seq 5000/6000.

<section>snRNA-seq data pre-processing</section>
<p>
Raw sequence files were demultiplexed into the fastq format using the
cellranger mkfastq command (Cell Ranger v2.1.0, 10X Genomics). A pre-mRNA
reference genome was generated including both introns and exons using the
commands recommended by 10X’s Cell Ranger pipeline. The “cellranger count”
command was used to generate gene expression matrices.
<p>
To remove ambient RNA (Fleming et al., 2019; Heaton et al., 2020; Smillie et
al., 2019; Young & Behjati, 2020), we used CellBender (Fleming et al., n.d.)
v2’s probabilistic model to generate corrected gene expression matrices after
ambient removal. CellBender was run on a Terra cloud computing environment
(https://app.terra.bio) on all raw gene expression matrices using the
remove-background-v2-alpha workflow with FPR=0.01 option. The total number of
nuclei identified by CellBender was 439,772.
<p>
Following ambient RNA correction, we removed “low-quality” nucleus profiles
defined as those with either <200 detected genes, >5,000 detected genes, or
<400 UMIs, retaining 265,831 nuclei passing QC. Protocol- and
individual-specific clusters and the clusters with high predicted doublet
proportions and mixed marker sets were removed manually retaining 209,126
nuclei for all subsequent analyses.
