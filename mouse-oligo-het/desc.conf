Oligodendrocytes have been considered as a functionally homogeneous population
in the central nervous system (CNS). We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on
5072 cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage from 10 regions of the mouse juvenile
and adult CNS. Thirteen distinct populations were identified, 12 of which
represent a continuum from Pdgfra(+) oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to
distinct mature oligodendrocytes. Initial stages of differentiation were
similar across the juvenile CNS, whereas subsets of mature oligodendrocytes
were enriched in specific regions in the adult brain. Newly formed
oligodendrocytes were detected in the adult CNS and were responsive to complex
motor learning. A second Pdgfra(+) population, distinct from OPCs, was found
along vessels. Our study reveals the dynamics of oligodendrocyte
differentiation and maturation, uncoupling them at a transcriptional level and
highlighting oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in the CNS.

<section>Clustering analysis</section>
<p>
Cells identify as oligodendrocyte lineage from all tissues were collected into an
oligodendrocyte dataset. Original full dataset include many experiments from different
tissues and selection strategies. Most of the date was collected using unbiased sampling
of cells, but some experiment included specific mice lines; 5Htr3A-EGFP,
Lhx6-CRERFP for striatum and Pdgfra-H2B-GFP, Pdgfra-Cre-RCE for corpus callosum,
hippocampus and cortex S1. The oligodendrocyte dataset is based on cells that identified
as related to the lineage in the first round of clustering of the larger dataset (>20,000
cells). Being aware of significant RNA carryover and doublets contamination in the C1
Fluidigm system, we removed all cells that expressed (2 molecules or more) markers for
endothelial cells (Ly6c1, Cldn5), astrocytes (Agt, Htra1) or vascular smooth muscle
(Acta2), which left us with 7487 cells. We use BackSpinV2 with the following 4
parameters: splitlev = 5; Nfeture1 = 500; Nfeture = 50; N_to_backspin = 150; N_to_cells
= 200; mean_tresh = 0.1; fdr_th = 0.3; min_gr_cells = 5; min_gr_genes = 3; which
resulted in 16 clusters as shown in Figure S14. BackSpinV2 uses binary splits as
described for BackSpin but is adaptive in the sense of the feature selection. We used
correlation as a distance for all clustering steps. Manual inspection of those clusters
results in merging three clusters (which had no clear difference, thus
represent oversplitting of the algorithm) and further exclusion of 2375 cells,
which show either low
quality or carryover from genes related to other types (marked in red bar in Fig S15).
This step was important to purify the signal specific for each cluster and avoid over
interpretation. At the end of this step we had 5862 cells and 13 clusters. Another 790 cells
were excluded after strong suspicion for mix between clusters, which was identified by
using mature oligodendrocytes genes which were highly express in OPC, committed
oligodendrocytes precursors or newly formed oligodendrocytes clusters. In practice we
removed cells that have either one of the early markers Bmp4, Itpr2, Cnksr3 and Neu4
together with one of the late markers Ctps, Mog (>100) and Klk6. Also Trf, Mal (markers
for mature oligodendrocytes) were used and cells that were classified to vascular and
leptomeningeal cells, OPC, differentiation-committed oligodendrocytes precursors and
newly formed oligodendrocyte population and express more than 80 molecules of those
genes were excluded. Finally, cells that still express both astrocytes markers Aqp4, Gja1
were excluded. The heatmap of the final 5072 cells in 13 clusters shown in Figure S1B.

<section>tSNE projections</section>
<p>
We use tSNE to visualize the dataset in 2D. tSNE projections shown in Figure 2A
were calculated on 5072 cells as data points after selecting 334 clustered enriched genes
as described above. We use 40 principle components, perplexity=80, epsilon (initial
learning rate)=100, number of iterations 1000 and correlation as distance measure.
