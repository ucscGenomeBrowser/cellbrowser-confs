<p>
Human lungs enable efficient gas exchange and form an interface with the
environment, which depends on mucosal immunity for protection against
infectious agents. Tightly controlled interactions between structural and
immune cells are required to maintain lung homeostasis. Here, we use
single-cell transcriptomics to chart the cellular landscape of upper and lower
airways and lung parenchyma in healthy lungs, and lower airways in asthmatic
lungs. We report location-dependent airway epithelial cell states and a novel
subset of tissue-resident memory T cells. In the lower airways of patients with
asthma, mucous cell hyperplasia is shown to stem from a novel mucous ciliated
cell state, as well as goblet cell hyperplasia. We report the presence of
pathogenic effector type 2 helper T cells (TH2) in asthmatic lungs and find
evidence for type 2 cytokines in maintaining the altered epithelial cell
states. Unbiased analysis of cellâ€“cell interactions identifies a shift from
airway structural cell communication in healthy lungs to a TH2-dominated
interactome in asthmatic lungs.
