<p>
During hemolysis, macrophages in the liver phagocytose damaged erythrocytes to
prevent the toxic effects of cell-free hemoglobin and heme. It remains unclear
how this homeostatic process modulates phagocyte functions in inflammatory
diseases. Using a genetic mouse model of spherocytosis and single-cell RNA
sequencing, we found that erythrophagocytosis skewed liver macrophages into an
antiinflammatory phenotype that we defined as MarcohiHmoxhiMHC class IIlo
erythrophagocytes. This phenotype transformation profoundly mitigated disease
expression in a model of an anti-CD40–induced hyperinflammatory syndrome with
necrotic hepatitis and in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis model, representing 2
macrophage-driven sterile inflammatory diseases. We reproduced the
antiinflammatory erythrophagocyte transformation in vitro by heme exposure of
mouse and human macrophages, yielding a distinctive transcriptional signature
that segregated heme-polarized from M1- and M2-polarized cells. Mapping
transposase-accessible chromatin in single cells by sequencing defined the
transcription factor NFE2L2/NRF2 as a critical driver of erythrophagocytes, and
Nfe2l2/Nrf2 deficiency restored heme-suppressed inflammation. Our findings
point to a pathway that regulates macrophage functions to link erythrocyte
homeostasis with innate immunity.
