abstract = """
The choroid plexus (ChP) is a protective epithelial barrier that filters blood
and secretes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), an important fluid for nutrient
maintenance in the brain, transport of signalling molecules, and is an
alternative route into the brain for therapeutic agents. Here, we establish
human ChP organoids with a selective epithelial barrier that secrete CSF-like
fluid in self-contained compartments, much like the CSF of brain ventricles.
Characterization of ChP organoids by single cell RNA sequencing reveals the
presence of epithelial and stromal ChP populations. Further subclustering of
choroid plexus epithelial cells also reveals subtypes corresponding to dark and
light cells, as well as myoepithelial and dividing epithelial populations.
These findings suggest a heterogeneous tissue containing specialised epithelial
and stromal cell types.

<section>Sample collection</section>\n
Single cell dissociation was performed by
first pooling two organoids for each condition: 55-day H9 telencephalic
organoids, 27-day H1 ChP (ChP sample 1), 46-day H1 ChP (ChP sample 2), and
53-day H1 ChP (ChP sample 3) into a 15ml tube. Samples were incubated in 1ml of
Accumax (Sigma, A7089) with 400μg DNase I and 15μM actinomycin D at 37°C for
20min wJumpHero?135
ith gentle agitation. At 5min intervals, the sample tubes were flicked
then pipetted 10 times. Clumps were allowed to settle and supernatant
collected, to which 100 μl FBS was added before filtration on a 35μm filter
tube (Corning, 352235). Samples were then spun at 300xg for 5min. Dead Cell
Removal kit and MACS column (Miltenyi, 130- 090-101) were used to remove dead
cells before another spin at 300g for 5min. Cells were resuspended in an
appropriate volume of 0.04% BSA in PBS to load 16,000 cells were well on the
10X Chromium system (10X Genomics). \n

<section>Analysis</section>\n
Single cell RNA-seq libraries were prepared according to manufacturers instructions using
the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10X
Genomics) workflow. The Chromium Controller was run according to the protocol
producing the single cell gel beads in emulsion mixture. Reverse transcriptase
reaction and subsequent amplification was carried out on a C1000 Touch Thermal
Cycler (Biorad) and libraries were quality tested using a 2100 Bioanalyzer
Instrument (Agilent). Samples were pooled together and sequenced on two lanes
of S1 flowcell of the Novaseq sequencer (Illumina). Raw sequencing output was
converted to the standard fastq format by bcl2fastq, before running through
CellRanger Count (version 3.1.0, 10X Genomics) which also performed read
alignment using STAR with GRCh38 human reference genome. QC output revealed
10,327 cells, with mean reads per cell of 39,973 and median UMI counts per cell
of 4,660 for telencephalic sample; 5,347 cells, with mean reads per cell of
67,938 and median UMI counts per cell of 16,252 for ChP sample 1; 8,603 cells,
with mean reads per cell of 45,030 and median UMI counts per cell of 9,927 for
ChP sample 2; 8,573 cells, with mean reads per cell of 41,815 and median UMI
counts per cell of 11,899 for ChP sample 3. The filtered feature barcode matrix
for each sample was then analysed further with the Seurat v3 R package by first
merging the matrices, followed by removal of cells with mitochondrial
percentage >30%, as demonstrated previously for other secretory organs (50),
and removal of likely doublets based on nCount_RNA, resulting in a total
dataset of 32,464 high-quality cells. Data were then normalizing for read depth
across cells, scaling the data, and variable feature finding using SCTransform.
Both mitochondrial mapping percentage and cell cycle were regressed out during
normalization to remove these confounding sources of variation. Unbiased
clustering was performed by principle component analysis (PCA) using ElbowPlot
to guide selection of the number of dimensions (4 principal components),
followed by FindNeighbors, FindClusters, and UMAP dimensionality reduction
visualization. Clusters were identified based on the top 10 differentially
expressed genes in each cluster, as well as analysis of known marker genes.
Sub-clustering of the mature ChP cluster was performed by first extracting the
mature ChP as a subset, followed by additional clustering and dimensionality
reduction using Seurat v3 FindNeighbors, FindClusters and UMAP dimensionality
reduction on PCs 1-12 (as determined by ElbowPlot).\n
