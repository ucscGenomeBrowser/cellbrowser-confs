<p>
A comprehensive cellular anatomy of normal human prostate is essential for
solving the cellular origins of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate
cancer. The tools used to analyze the contribution of individual cell types are
not robust. We provide a cellular atlas of the young adult human prostate and
prostatic urethra using an iterative process of single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry on ∼98,000 cells taken from different anatomical
regions. Immunohistochemistry with newly derived cell type-specific markers
revealed the distribution of each epithelial and stromal cell type on whole
mounts, revising our understanding of zonal anatomy. Based on discovered cell
surface markers, flow cytometry antibody panels were designed to improve the
purification of each cell type, with each gate confirmed by scRNA-seq. The
molecular classification, anatomical distribution, and purification tools for
each cell type in the human prostate create a powerful resource for
experimental design in human prostate disease.

<section>Single cell sequencing</section>
<p>
Three young human prostate specimens were used for single cell sequencing.
Single cell suspensions that were flow sorted for viability or gated for
specific populations were loaded into the 10x Genomics Chromium Controller
using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 17,400 total cells of each sample were loaded
on individual lanes of a Single Cell A Chip with appropriate reagents and run
in the Chromium Controller to generate single cell gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs)
for sample and cell barcoding. Libraries were generated using 10x Genomics’
protocol. Libraries were pooled and submitted for sequencing on an Illumina
NextSeq 500 in high output mode. 75 cycle flow-cells were used to sequence 26
cycles for read 1, 58 cycles read 2, and 8 cycles for the i7 index.

<section>Clustering analysis</section>
<p>
Three patient specimens dissected into transition and central zone and
peripheral zone. Each zone was sorted for viability before loading into the 10x
Genomics chromium controller. The 10x Genomics’ analysis pipeline, cellranger
(version 2.1.1) was first used to demultiplex and produce a gene-cell matrix.
Bcl files were demultiplexed using their barcode-aware wrapper for bcl2fastq
(version 2.17.1.14). Transcriptomes were aligned to GRCh38 using STAR (version
2.5.1b). Samples were then aggregated by downsampling to match their mean
mapped reads per cell. Low quality cell barcodes were filtered out using 10x
Genomics’ algorithm (high quality barcodes = total UMI count ≥ 10% of the 99th
percentile of the expected recovered cells). Table S2 displays the sequencing
metrics for each barcoded experiment.
</p>

<p>
Seurat (version 2.3.1), an R toolkit for single cell transcriptomics formed the
basis of further analysis (Butler et al., 2018) run on R version 3.4.1. Genes
that were expressed in three cells or less were filtered out along with cells
expressing fewer than 200 unique genes. Cell cycle state was predicted based on
Seurat’s built in principal-component (PC) analysis. Briefly, cells were scored
based on expression their expression of G2M and S phase genes (Kowalczyk et
al., 2015). Low quality cells and multiplets were excluded by removing cells
with fewer than 500 unique genes and greater than 3,000 unique genes, as well
as cells with greater than 10% of their transcriptome being mitochondrial
genes. Data was then scaled to 10,000 and log transformed. Mitochondrial genes
were then removed from further analysis. UMI counts were then scaled and
variation due to differences in UMI/cell, percent mitochondrial genes, and cell
cycle phase were regressed out of the data using a built-in Seurat function.
Cells from the three patients were then subsetted and recombined using
canonical correlation analysis (CCA) in order to align the clusters. The
highest variable genes were found with an algorithm developed by Macosko et al.
(Macosko et al., 2015), and were defined as an average expression between 0.2
and 5 with a dispersion greater than 1. The intersection of these genes between
the three patients were used to calculate 50 CCAs and the first 30 were
aligned. These 30 aligned-CCAs were used for t-SNE visualization and
clustering.
</p>

<p>
Cells were clustered using a graph-based clustering approach (Butler et al.,
2018). Briefly, cells were embedded in a KNN graph structure based on their
Euclidean distance in PC space, with edge weights refined by shared overlap in
their Jaccard distance. Different resolutions were generated based on a
granularity input.
