<p>
The developmental trajectory of human skeletal myogenesis and the transition
between progenitor and stem cell states are unclear. To address this, we employed
single cell RNAsequencing to profile human skeletal muscle tissues from embryonic,
fetal and postnatal stages. In silico, we identified myogenic as well as other cell types
and constructed a “roadmap” of human skeletal muscle ontogeny across development.
In a similar fashion, we also profiled the heterogeneous cell cultures generated from
multiple human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) myogenic differentiation protocols, and
mapped hPSC-derived myogenic progenitors to an embryonic-to-fetal transition period.
Additionally, we found differentially enriched biological processes and
discovered coregulated gene networks and transcription factors present at
distinct myogenic stages.

<p>
In summary, this work serves as a resource for advancing our knowledge of human
myogenesis. It also provides a tool for better characterization and
understanding of hPSC-derived myogenic progenitors for translational applications in
skeletal muscle based regenerative medicine.
