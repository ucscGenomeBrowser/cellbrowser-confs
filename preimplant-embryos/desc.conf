Mouse studies have been instrumental in forming our current understanding of
early cell-lineage decisions; however, similar insights into the early human
development are severely limited. Here, we present a comprehensive
transcriptional map of human embryo development, including the sequenced
transcriptomes of 1,529 individual cells from 88 human preimplantation embryos.
These data show that cells undergo an intermediate state of co-expression of
lineage-specific genes, followed by a concurrent establishment of the
trophectoderm, epiblast, and primitive endoderm lineages, which coincide with
blastocyst formation. Female cells of all three lineages achieve dosage
compensation of X chromosome RNA levels prior to implantation. However, in
contrast to the mouse, XIST is transcribed from both alleles throughout the
progression of this expression dampening, and X chromosome genes maintain
biallelic expression while dosage compensation proceeds. We envision broad
utility of this transcriptional atlas in future studies on human development as
well as in stem cell research.

<p>
Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using STAR with default settings
(Dobin et al., 2013) and only uniquely mapped reads were kept. Gene expression
levels (RefSeq annotations) were estimated in terms of reads per kilobase exon
model and per million mapped reads (RPKM) using rpkmforgenes (RamskÃ¶ld et al.,
2009). Read counts from regions where different RefSeq genes overlapped were
excluded. Genes were filtered, keeping 15,633 out of 26,178 genes that were
expressed in at least 5 out of 1,919 sequenced cells (RPKM>=10) and for
which cells with expression came from at least two different embryos. Cells
were quality-filtered based on four criteria, leaving 1,529 cells
post-filtering out of 1,919 sequenced cells. First, Spearman correlations,
using the RPKM expression levels of all genes, for every possible pair of cells
were calculated and a histogram of the maximum correlation obtained for each
cell, corresponding to the most similar cell, was used to identify 305 outlier
cells with a maximum pair-wise correlations below 0.63 (Figure 1A). Second, a
histogram of the number of expressed genes per cell was used to identify 330
outlier cells with less than 5000 expressed genes (Figure 1B). Third, a
histogram of the total transcriptional expression output from the sex
chromosomes (RPKM sum) was used to identify 33 cells with indeterminable sex,
or a called sex that was inconsistent with other cells of that embryo (see
Figure S1 and section "Calling Embryonic Sex", below). Fourth, 13
outlier cells were identified using PCA and t-SNE dimensionality reduction.
