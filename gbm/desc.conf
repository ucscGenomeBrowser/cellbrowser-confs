abstract = "Glioblastoma is a devastating form of brain cancer characterized by its aggressive, invasive growth and dismal prognosis. Previous work has noted intratumoral heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioblastoma, but the precise cell type composition remains unknown.<p>Here we use single-cell transcriptomics to develop a glioblastoma tumor cell atlas by mapping single cell RNA-sequencing of cancer cells onto a cellular reference framework of both the developing and adult human brain. By intersecting this atlas with known markers of glioblastoma cancer stem cells (GSCs), we unexpectedly identify a substantial heterogeneity of cell types that express GSC markers, and find that multiple GSC cell types expressing similar stemness markers exist within a single tumor. Some of these cell types have been characterized as potential cells of origin - tumor propagating cells - or cells that maintain the tumor microenvironment.<p>In addition to these previously characterized cell types, we also identify a population of cells similar to outer radial glia (oRG) stem cells, which are known to be important in normal human cortical development during both neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Using live time-lapse imaging of primary resected tumors, we discover that tumor derived oRG-like cells undergo a characteristic mitotic somal translocation behavior which previously has only been observed in human development.<p>In addition, we show that that a key marker of the oRG-like cells, PTPRZ1, a gene implicated in tumor invasiveness, is required for mitotic somal translocations. Furthermore, we explore tumor evolution from sorted PTPRZ1 positive, negative and unsorted populations from primary tumor resection specimens using an organoid transplant model, observing that PTPRZ1 positive cells are capable of giving rise to astrocyte and neuron cell types.<p>Our findings highlight that tumor cell type heterogeneity may arise from a diversity of GSC cell types, one of which is an oRG-like cell resembling a fetal neural stem cell."

methods = "We utilized 10X v2 Chromium sequencing to profile the composition of 11 primary glioblastoma tumors. These cells were processed using the cellranger 2.0 alignment tool, and normalized values (normalized to 1 for the maximum value in a cell, and multiplied by the median number of counts in a tumor) are included in the matrix of values."
