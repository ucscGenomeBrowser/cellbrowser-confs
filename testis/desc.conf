<p>Azoospermia is a condition defined as the absence of spermatozoa in the
ejaculate, but the testicular phenotype of men with azoospermia may be very
variable, ranging from full spermatogenesis to completely degenerated tissue
with ghost tubules. Hence, to understand a potential genetic contribution to
the pathogenesis of azoospermia we not only need to determine likely pathogenic
variants but we also need to consider in what cell types the effects may take
place.
<p>Advances in next-generation sequencing now allow whole-genome sequence at a
reasonable cost and technological developments also offer single-cell RNA
sequencing that can reveal the testicular expression of the affected genes.
However, in order to interpret single-cell RNA sequencing data properly,
substantial knowledge of the highly sophisticated data processing and
visualisation methods are needed.
<p>Here we review the complex cellular structure of the human testis and
outline how known genetic alterations affect the pathology of the testis. We
further combine the currently available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets
originating from the human testis into one dataset covering 62,751 testicular
cells, each with a median of 2,637 transcripts quantified. With the combined
dataset, we show; what effect the most common data-processing steps have, how
different visualisation methods can be used, calculate expression patterns in
pseudotime, and show how splicing rates can be used to determine the velocity
of differentiation during spermatogenesis. Throughout we show expression
patterns and network analysis of genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis
of azoospermia.

<p>Testis samples unselected and sequenced with 10X Genomics microdroplet
technique - plus some FACS sorted cell types - integrated from three different
publications (Sohni et al 2019, Hermann et al 2018, Guo et al 2018),
preprocessed and analyzed using Scanpy, scvelo and various R packages (see the
attached publication for details, or contact the corresponding author for more
