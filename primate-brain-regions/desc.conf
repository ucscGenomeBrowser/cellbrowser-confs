Identification of gene expression traits unique to the human brain sheds light
on the molecular mechanisms underlying human evolution. Here, we searched for
uniquely human gene expression traits by analyzing 422 brain samples from
humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and macaques representing 33 anatomical regions,
as well as 88,047 cell nuclei composing three of these regions. Among 33
regions, cerebral cortex areas, hypothalamus, and cerebellar gray and white
matter evolved rapidly in humans. At the cellular level, astrocytes and
oligodendrocyte progenitors displayed more differences in the human
evolutionary lineage than the neurons. Comparison of the bulk tissue and
single-nuclei sequencing revealed that conventional RNA sequencing did not
detect up to two-thirds of cell-type-specific evolutionary differences.

<section>Single-nuclei sequencing</section>
<p>
Frozen tissue samples of cingulate anterior cortex (BA24), cerebellar gray
matter, and caudate nucleus from brains of three individuals per species were
used for the intact nuclei isolation. For each brain region, three pooled
sample sets were prepared. Each sample set contained pooled equal tissue
samples of 5 mg for one human, one chimpanzee, one bonobo, and one macaque
individual (Fig. 3A). 
<p>
Single-nuclei experiments were performed using a 10x Chromium single cell 3′ v2
reagent kit by precisely following the detailed protocol of the manufacturer to
construct 10x Genomics single-cell 3′ libraries. Single nucleus libraries were
pooled at equal ratios and run using paired-end sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000
platform (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

<section>Data Processing</section>
<p>
A total of 3,081,653,593 paired-end sequencing reads of snRNA-seq were
processed using publicly available 10x Genomics software, Cell Ranger v2.2.0
(Zheng et al. 2017). 
<p>
The sparse expression matrix generated by cellranger analysis pipeline with the
list of 88,047 nuclei assigned to species was used as input to Seurat 3.0
(Stuart et al. 2019). To account for technical variation, we performed
cross-species integration. At the first step, for each species separately, we
performed normalization using “LogNormalize” with the scale factor of 10,000
and identified 2000 variable features. Next, we performed cross-species
integration by finding corresponding anchors between the species using 30
dimensions. We then computed 50 principal components and tested their
significances by jackstraw (Chung et al. 2015). We selected the first 30
principal components for subsequent t-SNE and clustering analyses.
