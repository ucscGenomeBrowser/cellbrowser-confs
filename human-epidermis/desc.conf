<p>
Perturbations in the transcriptional programs specifying epidermal
differentiation cause diverse skin pathologies ranging from impaired barrier
function to inflammatory skin disease. However, the global scope and
organization of this complex cellular program remain undefined. Here we report
single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of 92,889 human epidermal cells from 9
normal and 3 inflamed skin samples. Transcriptomics-derived keratinocyte
subpopulations reflect classic epidermal strata but also sharply
compartmentalize epithelial functions such as cell-cell communication,
inflammation, and WNT pathway modulation. In keratinocytes, ∼12% of assessed
transcript expression varies in coordinate patterns, revealing undescribed gene
expression programs governing epidermal homeostasis. We also identify molecular
fingerprints of inflammatory skin states, including S100 activation in the
interfollicular epidermis of normal scalp, enrichment of a CD1C+CD301A+ myeloid
dendritic cell population in psoriatic epidermis, and IL1βhiCCL3hiCD14+
monocyte-derived macrophages enriched in foreskin. This compendium of RNA
profiles provides a critical step toward elucidating epidermal diseases of
development, differentiation, and inflammation.

<section>Sequencing</section>
<p>
Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 libraries were sequenced with either an lllumina
HiSeq 2500, HiSeq 4000, or NovaSeq 6000 following the manufacturer’s protocol.
For libraries sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 (high output mode) or HiSeq
4000, the following sequencing parameters were used: read 1, 26 cycles; i7
index, 8 cycles; i5 index, 0 cycles; and read 2, 98 cycles. For libraries
sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 S2 reagent kit, the following paired-end
sequencing parameters were used: read 1, 26 cycles; i7 index, 8 cycles; i5
index, 0 cycles; and read 2, 91 cycles.

<section>Primary Computational Analysis</section>
<p>
Primary computational analysis started from raw Illumina sequencing data and
culminated in cell clusters. Raw data were processed using Cellranger (10X
Genomics version 2.0.2) and filtered using Seurat (Macosko et al., 2015;
Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Data Processing and QC Filtering). We
used zero-inflated negative binomial-based wanted variation extraction
(ZINB-WaVE) (Risso et al., 2018) to obtain a low dimensional representation of
cells, removing variations attributable to library size, mitochondrial read
composition, and batch effect. We used the Markov affinity-based graph
imputation of cells (MAGIC) imputation algorithm (van Dijk et al., 2017) with
cell-cell similarity measured by the ZINB-WaVE low-dimensional representation
to mitigate effects of dropout (Supplemental Experimental Procedures,
Imputation, Choice of Magic t Parameter). Imputed expression values were used
to cluster cells by applying principal component analysis (PCA), followed by
k-means-based approximate spectral clustering (Yan et al., 2009; Supplemental
Experimental Procedures, Principal Component Analysis, Spectral Clustering).
Finally, we used Slingshot (Street et al., 2018) to assign developmental
pseudotime to the scalp cells and demonstrated that the clustering results are
robust (Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Pseudotime, t-SNE Mapping,
Processing Time, and Sex-Specific Bias Analysis).
