Stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is comprised of basal
keratinocytes that execute a terminal differentiation program in overlying
suprabasal and superficial cell layers. Although morphologic progression
coupled with expression of specific molecular markers has been characterized
along the esophageal epithelial differentiation gradient, the molecular
heterogeneity within the cell types along this trajectory has yet to be
classified at the level of single cell resolution. To explore the molecular
characteristics of esophageal keratinocytes along the squamous differentiation
continuum, we performed single cell RNA-Sequencing transcriptomic profiling of
7,972 cells from murine esophageal epithelial sheets. We identified 8 distinct
cell clusters in esophageal epithelium, unveiling an unexpected level of
diversity, particularly among basal cells. We further mapped the cellular
pathways and lineage trajectories within basal, suprabasal, and superficial
clusters as well as within the heterogeneous basal cell populations, providing
a comprehensive molecular view of esophageal epithelial cells in the context of
squamous differentiation. Finally, we explored the impact of tissue aging upon
esophageal epithelial cell clusters and demonstrated that mitochondrial
dysfunction is a feature of aging in normal esophageal epithelium. These
studies provide an unparalleled molecular perspective on murine esophageal
keratinocytes that will serve as a valuable resource for dissecting cell
type-specific roles in esophageal biology under conditions of homeostasis,
aging, and tissue pathology.

<section>scRNA Library Preparation and Sequencing</section>
<p>
The inDrop System and single-cell RNA sequencing kit (1CellBio, Watertown MA)
were used for single cell encapsulation. Approximately 2,000 cells were
co-encapsulated in 1-3 nL droplets with barcode-labeled hydrogel beads and
reverse transcription/cell lysis reagents following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Oligonucleotide primers with cell barcodes were released from the
beads by an UV light exposure and reverse transcription was performed in the
emulsion of droplets in oil. Barcoded cDNA was released by breaking the
droplets after reverse transcription and stored at -80°C. Library preparation
was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions (1CellBio protocol
version 2.3). Libraries were sequenced at Fox Chase Cancer Center Genomic
Facility on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument using paired-end 2 x 50 base
pairs.

<section>Data Filtering, Integration, Dimensionality Reduction, and Clustering</section>
<p>
The matrices for each sample were imported and transformed into objects for
further processing (42). Genes expressed in 3 or fewer cells were excluded from
analysis. To eliminate dead cells or doublets, cells with the expression of
less than 250 unique genes or over 2,500, respectively, were excluded.
Additionally, cells with over 20% of their transcripts consisting of
mitochondrial genes were excluded. 7,972 cells remain after filtering, compared
to 10,701 before. Analysis of the filtered matrices follows the Seurat
integration workflow described by Stuart, et. Al (43). Each transcript count in
a cell was ‘LogNormalized’ (divided by the total number of genes in that cell,
and then multiplied by a scale factor of 10,000). The resulting number was then
natural-log transformed with log1p. For each matrix, the top 2000 variable
genes were calculated using variance-stabilizing transformation. CCA was then
used to find integration transcript anchors between all of the matrices. Genes
used for integration were ranked by the number of matrices they appear in. The
matrices were then merged according to the integration genes and re-normalized
using the LogNormalize procedure. From this point on, dimensionality reduction
used the genes and values that were pre-processed using the integration
workflow. However, the data unused for integration was retained for
differential gene testing in later steps. The resulting dataset was then scaled
and centered for dimensionality reduction. PCA was used for initial
dimensionality reduction and later for clustering, resulting in 30 principal
components. The PCA principal components were then used as input to the UMAP
dimensionality reduction procedure (arXiv:1802.03426), using 30 neighbors for
local neighborhood approximation and embedding into 2 components for
visualization. Because of our interest in the relationship between cell cycle
phases and cell fates, we opted not to regress cell cycle genes in our
dimensionality reduction steps. A Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph was then
constructed with the principal components of PCA by first determining the 20
nearest neighbors for each cell and subsequently creating the SNN guided by the
neighborhood overlap between each cell and 20 of its nearest neighbors.
Clusters were then determined by a modularity optimization algorithm by Waltman
and van Eck (44).
