<p>
Immunotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer is effective only for mismatch
repair-deficient tumors with high microsatellite instability that demonstrate
immune infiltration, suggesting that tumor cells can determine their immune
microenvironment. To understand this cross-talk, we analyzed the transcriptome
of 91,103 unsorted single cells from 23 Korean and 6 Belgian patients. Cancer
cells displayed transcriptional features reminiscent of normal differentiation
programs, and genetic alterations that apparently fostered immunosuppressive
microenvironments directed by regulatory T cells, myofibroblasts and myeloid
cells. Intercellular network reconstruction supported the association between
cancer cell signatures and specific stromal or immune cell populations. Our
collective view of the cellular landscape and intercellular interactions in
colorectal cancer provide mechanistic information for the design of efficient
immuno-oncology treatment strategies.

methods = """
<section>scRNA-seq and data processing</section>
<p>
For the SMC dataset, the cryopreserved single-cell dissociates were rapidly
thawed, washed and loaded into the Chromium system (10x Genomics) targeting
5,000 cells. For the KUL3 dataset, fresh single-cell suspensions were loaded
into the Chromium system. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, barcoded
sequencing libraries were generated using Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 Reagent
Kits and sequenced across 8 lanes on a HiSeq 4000 platform targeting 100,000
reads per cell for the SMC dataset. RNA-seq data for the KUL3 dataset were
generated using the NextSeq 500 and NovaSeq 6000 systems. Sequencing data were
aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) and processed using the
CellRanger 2.1.0 pipeline (10x Genomics). 

<section>UCSC Analysis</section>
<p>
At UCSC, the h5ad containing the raw UMI count matrix and metadata were feed into a generic scanpy pipeline to
generate UMAP and tSNE coordinates. It was assumed that the cells in the count matrix had
already been filtered for quality, so cell-filtering steps were skipped.
