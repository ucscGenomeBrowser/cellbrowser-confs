Fibroblasts are an essential cell population for human skin architecture and
function. While fibroblast heterogeneity is well established, this phenomenon
has not been analyzed systematically yet. We have used single-cell RNA
sequencing to analyze the transcriptomes of more than 5,000 fibroblasts from a
sun-protected area in healthy human donors. Our results define four main
subpopulations that can be spatially localized and show differential secretory,
mesenchymal and pro-inflammatory functional annotations. Importantly, we found
that this fibroblast ‘priming’ becomes reduced with age. We also show that
aging causes a substantial reduction in the predicted interactions between
dermal fibroblasts and other skin cells, including undifferentiated
keratinocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction. Our work thus provides evidence
for a functional specialization of human dermal fibroblasts and identifies the
partial loss of cellular identity as an important age-related change in the
human dermis. These findings have important implications for understanding
human skin aging and its associated phenotypes.

<section>Single-cell RNA sequencing</section>
<p>
For each experiment, 4-mm punch biopsies were obtained from healthy whole-skin
specimens, immediately after resection from the inguinoiliac region of five
male subjects. Donors’ characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
Samples were kept in MACS Tissue Storage Solution (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no.
130-100-008) for no longer than 1 h before their enzymatical and mechanical
dissociation with the Whole Skin Dissociation kit for human material (Miltenyi
Biotec, cat. no. 130-101-540) and the Gentle MACS dissociator (Miltenyi
Biotec), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell suspensions were then
filtered through 70-µm cell strainers (Falcon) and depleted of apoptotic and
dead cells with the Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no.
130-090-101).
<p>
Sequencing libraries were subsequently prepared following the Drop-seq
methodology, using a Chromium Single Cell Controller and the v2 chemistry
from 10X Genomics (cat. no. 120237). Thus, ~20,000 cells per sample were mixed
with the retrotranscription reagents and pipetted into a Chip A Single Cell
(10X Genomics, cat. no. 1000009), also containing the Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead
suspension and Partitioning Oil. The Chip was subsequently loaded into a
Chromium Single Cell Controller (10X Genomics) where the cells were captured in
nanoscale droplets containing both the reagents needed for reverse
transcription and a gel bead. Resulting gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs) were then
transferred to a thermocycler in order to perform the retrotranscription,
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Each gel bead contained a specific 10X
Genomics barcode, an Illumina R1 sequence, a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI)
and a poly-dT primer sequence. Therefore, from poly-adenylated mRNA the
reaction produced full-length cDNA with a unique barcode per cell and
transcript, which allowed tracing back all cDNA coming from each individual
cell. Following an amplification step, cDNA was further processed by
fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing double-sided size selection using
AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A63881). Finally, Illumina adaptors
and a sample index (10X Genomics, cat. no. 120262) were added through PCR using
a total number of cycles adjusted to the cDNA concentration. After sample
indexing, libraries were again subjected to double-sided size selection.
Quantification of the libraries was carried out using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay
Kit (Life Technologies), and cDNA integrity was assessed using D1000
ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies). Paired-end (26 + 74 bp) sequencing (100
cycles) was finally performed with a HiSeq 4000 device (Illumina).

<section>Data analysis</section>
<p>
Raw sequencing data was processed with Cell Ranger, version 2.1.0, from 10X
Genomics. For downstream analysis of the data we used the Seurat package
version 3.1.1 in R version 3.5.1. 16,062 cells passed the quality control
steps performed by Cell Ranger. To remove possible cell doublets, we filtered
out cells with more than 7500 expressed genes, and to remove potential
apoptotic cells we discarded cells with more than 5% mitochondrial reads. The
application of these filters resulted in a final dataset of 15,457 single-cell
transcriptomes.
<p>
In order to account for inter-individual differences and correct for batch
effects, we combined all our samples using the standard integration protocol
described in Seurat. In a first step, we performed standard pre-processing of
each dataset independently. This individual pre-processing included
log-normalization of the UMI counts and the identification of the 2000 more
variable genes per sample. Next, we used the function FindIntegrationAnchors()
with default parameters and 30 canonical correlation analysis (CCA) dimensions
to identify the integration anchors between our five datasets. These anchors
were subsequently used for integration using the IntegrateData() function,
again with the first 30 CCA dimensions and default parameters.
<p>
The integrated data were then used for standard cell clustering and
visualization with Seurat, which uses the 2000 most variable genes of the
integrated dataset as input. First, data were scaled using the ScaleData()
function and principal component analysis (PCA) dimensions were calculated with
the RunPCA() function. Next, unsupervised clustering of the data was performed
with the FindNeighbors() and FindClusters() functions. For the FindNeighbors()
function, we used the first 20 PCA dimensions to construct a Shared Nearest
Neighbor (SNN) Graph for our dataset. Then, we clustered the cells with the
function FindClusters() using a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity
optimization-based clustering algorithm with a resolution of 0.4. Finally, for
visualization, we used the RunUMAP() function with default parameters and 20
PCA dimensions.
<p>
To identify genes with enriched expression in each cell cluster we used the
FindAllMarkers() function in the integrated dataset. This function uses a
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to identify the representative genes of each cluster.
These representative genes were used to establish the cell identity of each
cluster, together with markers found in the literature for cell types typically
present in the human skin. Average expression of a particular set of marker
genes was used for cell type identification and was projected into UMAP or
violin plots. Gene expression signatures used for the definition of cell
populations were: ACTA2, RGS5 and PDGFRB (pericytes, clusters #8 and #10);
KRT5, KRT14, TP63, ITGB1, and ITGA6 (epidermal stem cells and other
undifferentiated progenitors, clusters #7 and #15); KRT1, KRT10, SBSN, and
KRTDAP (differentiated keratinocytes, cluster #5); PDGFRA, LUM, DCN, VIM, and
COL1A2 (fibroblasts, clusters #1, #2, #3 and #9); AIF1, LYZ, HLA-DRA, CD68, and
ITGAX (macrophages and dendritic cells (DC), clusters #0, #13 and #16); CD3D,
CD3G, CD3E, and LCK (T cells, cluster #6); SELE, CLDN5, VWF, and CDH5
(vascular endothelial cells, cluster #4); PROX1, CLDN5, and LYVE1 (lymphatic
endothelial cells, cluster #12); HBA1, HBA2, and HBB (erythrocytes, cluster
#11) and PMEL, MLANA, TYRP1, and DCT (melanocytes, cluster #14).
<p>
For the second-level clustering of the fibroblasts (Supplementary Figs. 4a, b)
we subsetted the cells and ran again the functions FindNeighbors() and
FindClusters(). In this case, we used 20 PCA dimensions for both functions and
a resolution of 0.5 for the FindClusters() function. For visualization we
re-calculated the UMAP plot with RunUMAP() function with default parameters and
using 20 PCA dimensions.
<p>
Aiming to infer age-related differences, we first used the FindAllMarkers()
function to identify those genes whose expression is enriched in each cell
cluster of the young and old skin datasets separately. To obtain the genes
differentially expressed by each fibroblast cluster upon aging we used the
FindMarkers() function.
