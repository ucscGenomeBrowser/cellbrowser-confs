<p>
The human retina is a complex tissue responsible for detecting photons of light
and converting information from these photons into the neurochemical signals
interpreted as vision. Such visual signaling not only requires sophisticated
interactions between multiple classes of neurons, but also spatially-dependent
molecular specialization of individual cell types. In this study, we performed
single-cell RNA sequencing on neural retina isolated from both the fovea and
peripheral retina in three human donors. We recovered a total of 8,217 cells,
with 3,578 cells originating from the fovea and 4,639 cells originating from
the periphery. Expression profiles for all major retinal cell types were
compiled, and differential expression analysis was performed between cells of
foveal versus peripheral origin. Globally, mRNA for the serum iron binding
protein transferrin (TF), which has been associated with age-related macular
degeneration pathogenesis, was enriched in peripheral samples. Cone
photoreceptor cells were of particular interest and formed two predominant
clusters based on gene expression. One cone cluster had 96% of cells
originating from foveal samples, while the second cone cluster consisted
exclusively of peripherally isolated cells. A total of 148 genes were
differentially expressed between cones from the fovea versus periphery.
Interestingly, peripheral cones were enriched for the gene encoding
Beta-Carotene Oxygenase 2 (BCO2). A relative deficiency of this enzyme may
account for the accumulation of carotenoids responsible for yellow pigment
deposition within the macula. Overall, this data set provides rich expression
profiles of the major human retinal cell types and highlights transcriptomic
features that distinguish foveal and peripheral cells.

Methods: Independent libraries were prepared for foveal and peripheral samples
of neural retina from three donors using the 10x Chromium system. Libraries
were sequenced on a HiSeq4000. Sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome
build hg19 will CellRanger(v3.0.1) and filters removed cells likely to be
doublets or cells with a high proportion of mitochondrial reads. Clustering of
cells with similar expression profiles was performed with Seurat (v2.3.4).
