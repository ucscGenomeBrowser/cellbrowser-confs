<p>
The innate immune cell compartment is highly diverse in the healthy central
nervous system (CNS), including parenchymal and non-parenchymal macrophages.
However, this complexity is increased in inflammatory settings by the
recruitment of circulating myeloid cells. It is unclear which disease-specific
myeloid subsets exist and what their transcriptional profiles and dynamics
during CNS pathology are. Combining deep single-cell transcriptome analysis,
fate mapping, in vivo imaging, clonal analysis, and transgenic mouse lines, we
comprehensively characterized unappreciated myeloid subsets in several CNS
compartments during neuroinflammation. During inflammation, CNS macrophage
subsets undergo self-renewal, and random proliferation shifts toward clonal
expansion. Last, functional studies demonstrated that endogenous CNS tissue
macrophages are redundant for antigen presentation. Our results highlight
myeloid cell diversity and provide insights into the brain's innate immune
system.

<section>Mice</section>
<p>
C57BL/6N mice were used as WT mice and all transgenic lines were on a C57BL/6
background. Mice were bred in-house under pathogen-free conditions. Passive EAE
was induced by intravenous injection of MOG-reactive lymphocytes. 

<section>scRNA-seq and Analysis</section>
<p>
Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed using the mCEL-Seq2 protocol, an
automated and miniaturized version of CEL-Seq2 on a mosquito nanoliter-scale
liquid-handling robot. Fifty-four libraries were sequenced and after quality
control 3461 cells (PV: 1324, Men: 1052, CP: 701, Blood: 384) were analyzed.
Data analysis and visualization were performed using the RaceID3 algorithm.
Cells with a total number of transcripts < 1,500 were discarded and count data
of the remaining cells were normalized by downscaling. Cells expressing &gt;2% of
Kcnq1ot1, a potential marker for low-quality cells, were not considered for
analysis.
