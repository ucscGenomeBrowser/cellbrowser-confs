Single-cell multiomics (ATAC-seq + RNA-seq) of human gray matter.

<p>
The multiomics data has been split into matrices that cover gene activity, ATAC
ranges, ATAC peaks, and RNA-seq. Select a dataset on the left to color the plot
by that assay.

<p>
Nuclei were isolated from two 10mg fresh-frozen human grey matter brain samples
(collected under the Imperial College Research Ethics Committee ICREC_14_2_11),
using Nuclei Pure Prep Nuclei Isolation Kit (Sigma Aldrich) with the following
modifications. The tissue was lysed in Nuclei Pure Lysis Solution with 0.1%
Triton X, 1mM DTT and 0.4U/ul SUPERase-In™ RNase Inhibitor (ThermoFisher
Scientific) freshly added before use, and homogenized with the help first of a
23G and then of a 29G syringe. Cold 1.8M Sucrose Cushion Solution, prepared
immediately before use with the addition of1mM DTTand 0.4U/ul RNase Inhibitor,
was added to the suspensions before they were filtered through a 30μm strainer.
The lysates were then carefully and slowly layered on top of 1.8M Sucrose
Cushion Solution previously added in new Eppendorf tubes. Samples were
centrifuged for 45 minutes at 16000xg at 4°C. Pellets were re-suspended in
Nuclei Storage Buffer with RNase Inhibitor, transferred in new Eppendorf tubes
and centrifuged twice for 5 minutes at 500xg at 4°C. Finally purified nuclei
were re-suspended in Nuclei Storage Buffer with RNase Inhibitor, stained with
trypan blue and counted using Countess II (Life technology).

<p>
After count, nuclei permeabilization was carried out following the demonstrated
protocol for single cell multiome ATAC + Gene Expression sequencing from 10x
Genomics. A total of 12,000 estimated nuclei from each sample was used for the
transposition step and then loaded on the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Chip J.
ATAC library and gene expression library construction was performed using the
Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were sequenced using Illumina
NovaSeq 6000 System and NovaSeq 6000 S2 Reagent Kit v1.5 (100 cycles), aiming
at a minimum sequencing depth of 30K reads/nucleus.

<section>Data_processing</section>
<p>
Single cell multiome human (10X Genomics) data samples were processed with
default parameters with cellranger-arc (v2.0.0) count function. Reads were
aligned to GRCh38 (refdata-cellranger-arc-GRCh38-2020-A-2.0.0‎) reference
genome. Which resulted for each sample PD003 and PD004 of a median fragments
per cell of 21422/22379, median UMI counts per cell of 7407/8189, median genes
per cell of 2972/3268 and 5272/4513 cells.
<p>
Normalized single feature-barcode matrix combining the two individuals from
both modalities was calculated with the parameter cellranger-arc aggr with
default parameters, samples were normalized to depth for both ATAC and gene
expression modalities. We used Cellranger-arc called peaks for preQC
measurements. After QC we run macs2 whithin Seurat/Signac to call the peaks, to
recover consistent peak set within the whole dataset. For downstrean analyses
we combined Signac v1.4.0 and Seurat v4.0.0 joint RNA and ATAC analysis. We
used as QC metrics nCount_ATAC < 100000 & nCount_RNA < 100000 & nCount_ATAC >
1000 & nCount_RNA > 1000 & nucleosome_signal < 2 & TSS.enrichment > 1, which
resulted in a total 4194 and 3670 cells from each individual sample.
<p>
Dimension reduction and Findclusters was performed same as for single cell
multiome mouse data. Samples were integrated using Harmony on the patient
variable. Cells were annotated using a panel of canonical markers for main
brain cell types; 'PLP1','MAG','MOG','OPALIN' for Oligocendrocytes.
'PDGFRA','SOX6','BCAN' for OPCs. 'FGFR3','GFAP','SLC14A1','AQP4' for
Astrocytes. 'P2RY12','SPP1','CSF1R','IRF8' for Microglia.
'SLC17A7','FEZF2','RORB' for Excitatory Neurons. 'GAD1','ADARB2','LHX6' for
Inhibitory Neurons. 'CLDN5','FLT1','EPAS1', 'EPS8','LAMA2' for Endothelial and
Stromal cells. In order to get clear celltypes on the ATAC called peaks we
discarded combinations of canonical markers from different main celltypes from
the RNA expression. We then called peaks using MACS2 grouped by defined
celltype.
