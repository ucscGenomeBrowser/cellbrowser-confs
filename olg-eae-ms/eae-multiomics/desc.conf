Single-cell multiomics (ATAC-seq + RNA-seq) of mouse EAE models.

The multiomics data has been split into matrices that cover gene activity, ATAC
ranges, ATAC peaks, and RNA-seq. Select a dataset on the left to color the plot
by that assay.

<section>Treatment protocol</section>
<p>
For the induction of EAE, the mouse model of MS, animals were injected
subcutaneously with an emulsion of MOG35-55 peptide in complete Freud’s
adjuvant (CFA; EK-2110 kit from Hooke Laboratories) followed by intraperitoneal
injection with pertussis toxin in PBS (200 ng per animal) on the day of
immunization and with 24 hours delay (according to manufacturer’s
instructions). Control animals underwent the same treatment, but CFA without
MOG35-55 peptide (CK-2110 kit from Hooke Laboratories) was used instead. Spinal
cord and brains were collected at the peak of the disease when clinical score 3
has been reached, which corresponds to limp tail and complete paralysis of hind
legs. Animals that did not reach this clinical score were not analyzed in this
study.

<section>Extraction protocol</section>
<p>
Mice were sacrificed with a ketaminol/xylazine intraperitoneal injection
followed by intracardiac perfusion with PBS where after spinal cords were
collected and dissociated using the adult brain dissociation kit (130-107-677,
Miltenyi) following manufacturer’s instructions. Instead of myelin debris
removal (Miltenyi), Percoll (Cytiva 17-0891-01) mixed with HBSS was used to
generate a percoll gradient of 38% to remove myelin debris. Immediately after
dissociation, cells were stained with DAPI and sorted on a FACS Aria III cell
sorter (BD Biosciences). Sox10GFP+/DAPI- cells were collected in PBS + 0.5%
BSA. The pool of cells was then lysed and washed according to the Demonstrated
Protocol: Nuclei Isolation for Single cell ATAC Sequencing (10x Genomics) with
modifications from the Demonstrated Protocol: Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell
Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (10x Genomics) as follows: the cells
were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 300xg and 4°C, resuspended in ATAC lysis
buffer (containing 0.01% IGEPAL (CA-630), 0.01% Tween-20, 0.001% Digitonin, 1%
BSA, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/ul RNase inhibitor, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM
MgCl2) and incubated on ice for 3 minutes. After the incubation, wash buffer
(containing 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/ul RNase inhibitor, 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2) was added on top without mixing and
the nuclei were centrifuged for 5 min at 500xg and 4°C. Nuclei were washed once
in Diluted Nuclei buffer (10x Genomics) containing 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/ul
RNase inhibitor, and incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C in tagmentation mix (10x
Genomics). The Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression v1
Chemistry was used to create single nuclei ATAC and RNA libraries from the same
cell. Two EAE and two CFA-Ctr animals were used for independent replicates.
Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 with a 50-8-24-49 read
set-up for ATAC (minimum 25 000 read pairs per cell) and a 28-10-10-90 read
set-up for RNA (minimum 20 000 read pairs per cell). Chromium Next GEM Single

<p>
Samples for RNA modality were sequenced on NovaSeq6000 (NovaSeq Control
Software 1.7.5/RTA v3.4.4) with a 28nt(Read1)-10n
(Index1)-10nt(Index2)-90nt(Read2) setup using 'NovaSeqStandard' workflow in
'SP' mode flowcell. The Bcl to FastQ conversion was performed using
bcl2fastq_v2.20.0.422 from the CASAVA software suite. The quality scale used is
Sanger / phred33 / Illumina 1.8+.

Samples for ATAC modalidity were sequenced on NovaSeq6000 (NovaSeq Control

50nt(Read1)-8nt(Index1)-24nt(Index2)-49nt(Read2) setup using 'NovaSeqStandard'

Sanger / phred33 / Illumina 1.8+.
<p>
Single cell multiome mouse (10X Genomics) data was processed with default
parameters with cellranger-arc (v2.0.0) count function. Reads were aligned to
mm10 (ata-cellranger-arc-mm10-2020-A-2.0.0) reference genome. Normalized
single feature-barcode matrix combining all the samples from both modalities
was calculated with the parameter cellranger-arc aggr with default parameters,
samples were normalized to depth for both ATAC and gene expression modalities.
which resulted in a median fragments per cell of 12928, median UMI counts per
cell of 4240, median genes per cell of 1849 and 5769 cells.
<p>
We used Cellranger-arc (v2.0.0) called peaks for preQC measurements. After QC
we run macs2 whithin Seurat/Signac to call the peaks, to recover consistent
peak set within the whole dataset. For downstrean analyses we combined Signac
v1.4.0 and Seurat v4.0.0 joint RNA and ATAC analysis. We used as QC metrics
nCount_ATAC < 100000 & nCount_RNA < 25000 & nCount_ATAC > 500 & nCount_RNA >
500 & nucleosome_signal < 2 & TSS.enrichment > 1, which resulted in 5264 cells.
