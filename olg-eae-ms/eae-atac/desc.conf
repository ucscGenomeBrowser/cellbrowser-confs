<section>Treatment protocol</section>
<p>
For the induction of EAE animals were injected subcutaneously with an emulsion
of MOG35-55 peptide in complete Freud’s adjuvant (CFA; EK-2110 kit from Hooke
Laboratories) followed by intraperitoneal injection with pertussis toxin in PBS
(200 ng per animal) on the day of immunization and with 24 hours delay
(according to manufacturer’s instructions). Control animals underwent the same
treatment, but CFA without MOG35-55 peptide (CK-2110 kit from Hooke
Laboratories) was used instead. Spinal cord and brains were collected at the
peak of the disease when clinical score 3 has been reached, which corresponds
to limp tail and complete paralysis of hind legs. Animals that did not reach
this clinical score were not analyzed in this study.

<section>Extraction protocol</section>
<p>
Mice were sacrificed with a ketaminol/xylazine intraperitoneal injection
followed by intracardiac perfusion with PBS where after brain and spinal cords
were collected and dissociated using the adult brain dissociation kit
(130-107-677, Miltenyi) following manufacturer’s instructions including myelin
debris removal, but excluding the red blood cell removal step.
<p>
Immediately after dissociation, cells were stained with DAPI and sorted on a
FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Sox10GFP+/DAPI- cells were
collected in PBS + 0.5% BSA and pooled with Sox10GFP-/DAPI- cells with a 4:1
ratio. The pool of cells was then lysed and washed according to the
Demonstrated Protocol: Nuclei Isolation for Single cell ATAC Sequencing (10x
Genomics) as follows: the cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 300xg and
4°C, resuspended in ATAC lysis buffer (containing 0.1% IGEPAL (CA-630), 0.1%
Tween-20, 0.01% Digitonin, 1% BSA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM
MgCl2) and incubated on ice for 3 minutes. After the incubation, wash buffer
(containing 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM
MgCl2) was added on top without mixing and the nuclei were centrifuged for 5
min at 500xg and 4°C. Nuclei were washed once in Diluted Nuclei buffer (10x
Genomics) containing 1% BSA, before adding to the tagmentation mix (10x
Genomics). The Chromium Single Cell ATAC v1 Chemistry was used to create
single-cell ATAC libraries. Two EAE and four CFA-control animals were used for
independent replicates. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000
with a 50-8-16-49 read set-up and a minimum of 25 000 read pairs per cell. 

<section>Sequencing and Data_processing</section>
<p>
Chromiun Single Cell ATAC v1 Chemistry was used to create the scATAC-seq
libraries. Samples were sequenced in Illumina NovaSeq and demultiplexed.
Demultiplexed samples were converted to fastq files and aligned to mm10
reference assembly and process using Cellranger-ATAC count (version 1.2.0) and
cellranger-atac aggr. Normalizing the sequencing depth. Cellranger-atac aggr
output bam files, peaks file and fragment file were used as input for
Seurat/Signac v0.25 R packages for downstream analysis. Final cells were
selected following the QC parameters below, min peak region 1000 fragments and
maximun 20000 resulting in 4895 cells. Cells were clustered based on peaks and
annotated using reference annotations from Falcao, van Bruggen et al. 2018
Nature Medicine.
