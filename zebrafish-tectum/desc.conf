We studied cell recruitment following optic tectum (OT) injury in zebrafish
(Danio rerio), which has a remarkable ability to regenerate many of its organs,
including the brain. The OT is the largest dorsal layered structure in the
zebrafish brain. In juveniles, it is an ideal structure for imaging and
dissection. We investigated the recruited cells within the juvenile OT during
regeneration in a Pdgfrβ-Gal4:UAS-EGFP line in which pericytes, vascular,
circulating, and meningeal cells are labeled, together with neurons and
progenitors. We first performed high-resolution confocal microscopy and
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) on EGFP-positive cells. We then tested
three types of injury with very different outcomes (needle (mean depth in the
OT of 200 µm); deep-laser (depth: 100 to 200 µm depth); surface-laser (depth: 0
to 100 µm)). Laser had the additional advantage of better mimicking of ischemic
cerebral accidents. No massive recruitment of EGFP-positive cells was observed
following laser injury deep in the OT. This type of injury does not perturb the
meninx/brain–blood barrier (BBB). We also performed laser injuries at the
surface of the OT, which in contrast create a breach in the meninges.
Surprisingly, one day after such injury, we observed the migration to the
injury site of various EGFP-positive cell types at the surface of the OT. The
migrating cells included midline roof cells, which activated the PI3K-AKT
pathway; fibroblast-like cells expressing numerous collagen genes and most
prominently in 3D imaging; and a large number of arachnoid cells that probably
migrate to the injury site through the activation of cilia motility genes, most
likely being direct targets of the FOXJ1a gene. This study, combining
high-content imaging and scRNAseq in physiological and pathological conditions,
sheds light on meninges repair mechanisms in zebrafish that probably also
operate in mammalian meninges.  """

Zebrafish Husbandry and Transgenic Lines</h4><div class="html-p">Eggs obtained by natural spawning were bleached and incubated at 28 °C in embryonic medium (EM) [<a href="#B20-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">20</a>]. Zebrafish embryos were reared according to standard procedures, as previously described [<a href="#B20-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">20</a>]. Wild-type (WT) and <span class="html-italic">casper</span> zebrafish were obtained from ZIRC (Eugene, OR, USA) or EZRC (Karlsruhe, Germany). The environmental parameters were as follows: photoperiod = 14 h light/10 h dark, temperature = 26.5 ± 1 °C, pH = 7.8 ± 0.1; conductivity = 240 ± 30 μS/cm, [NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] = 0 mg/L, [NO<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>] = 0 mg/L, [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>] &lt; 50 mg/L. Fish were fed with rotifers (<span class="html-italic">Brachionus plicatilis</span>, ~500/fish/day) for two weeks, and then with brine shrimps (<span class="html-italic">Artemia nauplii</span>, ~250/fish/day) and dry food (Skretting, Gemma Micro, twice daily). All protocols were approved by the local ethics committee for animal experimentation (CEEA 59) and the French Ministry of Research and Education. All procedures were performed in accordance with European Union Directive 2011/63/EU, with the approval of the local ethics committee (no. 59 CEEA). The lines used in this study were TgBAC(Pdgfrβ:gal4FF)<sup>ncv24</sup>, Tg(5×UAS;EGFP)<sup>nkuasgfp1a</sup>, Tg (kdrl:DsRed) [<a href="#B16-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">16</a>].

Three Types of OT Injury</h4><div class="html-p">We prepared a stock solution of 10× ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (MS222) for anesthesia by dissolving 400 mg of tricaine powder and 800 mg sodium bicarbonate in 200 mL EM [<a href="#B20-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">20</a>]. Before mounting, 21 dpf zebrafish were transferred from their tanks to a Petri dish containing 0.5× MS222 solution. Anesthesia treatment was stopped after 45–60 s, when the fish stopped swimming, and 7.8 mm/21 dpf juveniles were mounted in aligned wells in agarose plates. These wells were obtained by placing 3D-printed plastic molds with 12 wells in negative, mimicking juvenile body shapes, on top of 1% agarose. These wells prevented most of the movements of the juveniles. Fish movement was further prevented by applying a drop of 1.5% low-melting point agarose (LMA) at the tail end. The LMA took about 10 s to harden at normal room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C). The plate was then filled with EM containing 0.5× MS222 during the brain injury process. Plastic Pasteur pipettes and paint brushes were used to transfer the fish to 3D printed wells and to orient them dorsally. The fish were injured, as described below, and transferred to fresh fish embryonic medium. Air bubbles were applied with a pump to help the juveniles recover. After recovery, the fish displayed normal swimming and feeding behavior.</div><section id="sec2dot2dot1-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="" data-nested="3" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.2.1. Deep Multiphoton Laser Injury</h4><div class="html-p">The center of the OT was burnt with a laser in a parallelepiped volume of 88 × 88 × 100 µm (<span class="html-italic">x</span>,<span class="html-italic">y</span>,<span class="html-italic">z</span>) at a depth of 100 µm into the brain tissue. A Leica TCS SP8 MP multiphoton microscope equipped with a 25× objective was used for laser injury. The biphoton laser was tuned to a wavelength of 750 µM, and a power of 2.5 mW with an intensity of 50% and an offset of 45%. These parameters were used for the injury of the selected area with a 2 µm z-step, in bidirectional scanning mode, with a pixel size of 2 µm. The injured juveniles were revived according to the procedure described in <a href="#sec2dot3-cells-11-02016" class="html-sec">Section 2.3</a>.</div></section><section id="sec2dot2dot2-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="" data-nested="3" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.2.2.

We focused the laser on the center of the surface of the OT volume.

Live Imaging of Zebrafish Larvae</h4><div class="html-p">For live confocal imaging, juvenile zebrafish were anesthetized in EM medium containing 0.5× MS-222 and mounted in the appropriate orientation in 1.5% low-melting point agarose (Ultrapure Low Melting Point, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). A mounting plate was prepared with dentistry silicone (Picodent, Wipperfürth, Germany) and a negative 3D-printed plastic mold. During imaging, juveniles were covered with EM containing 0.5× MS-222. Imaging was performed with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a water immersion objective (25×). Pixel size was 1.16 µm × 1.16 µm (along the <span class="html-italic">x</span> and <span class="html-italic">y</span> axes) and 2 µm along the <span class="html-italic">z</span> axis. Stacks of about 300 µm were acquired. The duration of each experiment at each time point was kept as short as possible—typically 25 to 30 min, including about 10 min of imaging—to ensure that the zebrafish juveniles remained alive and efficiently recovered. The area of each imaged sample could be iteratively identified at successive time points according to the Kdrl-DsRed pattern. After each acquisition, the juveniles were released from the low-melting point agarose, revived in fresh aerated tank water, and then returned to the facility tanks until the next acquisition.</div></section><section id="sec2dot4-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="html-italic" data-nested="2" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.4. Immunohistochemistry</h4><div class="html-p">We adapted classical antibody protocols for the staining of meningeal cells from 21 dpf zebrafish without cell destruction and minimizing the background. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed with a higher than usual percentage of saponin to allow penetration through the skin. High dilutions of antibodies and short incubation times were used to prevent excessive background staining.</div><div class="html-p">The 21 dpf juveniles were killed by immersion in 10× MS-222 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Samples were then fixed by incubation in freshly prepared 4% PFA-PBS for 30 min at room temperature (RT), rinsed quickly with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST), and washed six times, for five minutes each, in PBST at RT with gently shaking. The samples were incubated with blocking reagent (10% NGS, 10% DMSO, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% saponin in PBS) for two hours at RT before immunostaining. They were then incubated overnight at RT with primary antibodies (anti-Aqp1a.1 antibody 1:250 [<a href="#B22-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">22</a>] and anti-GT335 1:1000 [<a href="#B23-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">23</a>]) in fast staining solution (2% NGS, 20% DMSO, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 µg/mL heparin, 0.5% saponin in PBS), with gentle shaking. Samples were then washed six times in PBST, for 10 min each, with gentle shaking, and were incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies in fast staining solution for 4 h at RT. Throughout this process, the samples were kept in complete darkness. Finally, the samples were thoroughly washed six times, for 10 min each, in PBST, with shaking. For image acquisition, samples were placed in a high-refractive index clearing medium (adjusted to a refractive index of 1.457). We added 225 g sucrose, 100 g nicotinamide, 50 g triethanolamine, 500 µL Triton X-100, and 500 mL double-distilled water 500 mL for each 100 mL of medium. Successive incubations were performed in 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% clearing medium, for 30 min each, with gentle shaking. Samples were imaged with a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with 25× and 40× objective objectives for high resolution. The images were analyzed with Amira (2019) and ImageJ software.</div></section><section id="sec2dot5-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="html-italic" data-nested="2" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.5. Cell Dissociation</h4><div class="html-p">We dissected ten OTs and collected them in an Eppendorf tube placed in ice and filled with cold PBS supplemented with 5% Bovine Serum Albumine (BSA). The dissection step had to be performed sufficiently quickly to prevent cell degradation. The dissected OTs were transferred to 400 µL of dissociation buffer (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergish Gladbash, Germany. Cells were dissociated by gentle trituration with a glass pipette. The pipette was iteratively filled with the dissociation buffer and pieces of dissected OTs, which were then released into the Eppendorf tube. After trituration, the sample was centrifuged at 4 °C at 300× <span class="html-italic">g</span> for ten minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL cold PBS. The suspension was passed through a sterile filter with 50 µm pores to remove clumps of cells before introduction into the cell sorter.</div></section><section id="sec2dot6-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="html-italic" data-nested="2" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.6. Sample Preparation for Cell Sorting</h4><div class="html-p">FACS was performed with a slightly modified version of a published protocol for zebrafish juveniles (<a href="#app1-cells-11-02016" class="html-app">Supplementary Figure S4</a>) [<a href="#B24-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">24</a>]. Isolated cells were sorted by flow cytometry with a MoFlo Astrios_EQ© cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France), in PuraFlow 1× sheath fluid (Beckman Coulter) at 25 psi (pounds per square inch), with a 100-micron nozzle. We performed sorting with a drop drive frequency of ~43 kHz, plate voltages of 4000–4500 V, and an amplitude of 30–50 V. Sorting was performed in purity mode. The 488-SSC (side scatter) parameter was set as the threshold. Cell gates were first set on the FSC-area (forward scatter) versus SSC-area plot. Doublets were discarded by gating on the SSC-area versus SSC-height plot. A DAPI-positive gate was also used to exclude dead cells. Finally, EGFP-positive cells were selected for sorting and compared with EGFP-negative samples. Gating accuracy was determined by post-sorting microscopy. The flow cytometer-sorted cells (10 to 20 thousand cells) were collected in 1.5 mL tubes for sequencing.</div></section><section id="sec2dot7-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="html-italic" data-nested="2" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.7. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq)</h4><div class="html-p">After FACS, the cells were collected in 1×PBS-like medium (pH 7.4) at a density of 300 cells/µL in 50 µL. Because only 30 µL could be loaded in the 10× Genomics chip, 9000 cells (with a target recovery of 6000 cells) were used with a ‘Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ V2’ kit. We generated cDNAs with a Chromium Controller, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Libraries for Illumina sequencing were prepared according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and approximately 6000 cells were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550, with paired end 26–134 bp sequencing runs. Raw reads were aligned to the Zebra_Ensembl_102 version of the zebraFish genome GRCZ11 from Ensembl [<a href="#B25-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">25</a>] using the Cell Ranger 3.1.0 pipeline. The EGFP sequence was added to the annotated genome to perform alignments. Experiment 1 generated 2956 cells originating from control juveniles and 3025 cells from injured fish. Similarly, experiment 2 generated 2085 and 3019 cells.</div></section><section id="sec2dot8-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="html-italic" data-nested="2" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.8. Quality Control, Batch Correction, and Doublet Removal</h4><div class="html-p">First, a single dataset from two control samples arising from two independent experiments was created using the merge() function for cell heterogeneity analysis. Second, another dataset was generated including cells from control and injured fish from the two same independent experiments. Because the same protocol was followed in the two experiments, we considered them as technical replicates. For each analysis, cells were selected if they had (1) between 100 and 7500 features expressed, (2) between 1500 reads and 50,000 reads, (3) less than 2.9% of mitochondrial genes, and (4) more than three EGFP reads. These parameters identified 575 and 448 cells for control fish and 603 and 597 cells for the injured fish. Following quality control, all downstream analyses were implemented using the R package Seurat V4 from the Satija lab [<a href="#B26-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">26</a>]. Data were normalized using the NormalizeData() function using the LogNormalize method with a scale factor of 10,000. The 2000 top variable genes were selected using the FindVariableFeatures() function. A standard scaling with no regression was done using the function ScaleData(). PCA were calculated on the Top 2000 variable genes using the RunPCA() function. A significant amount of overlap between datasets was observed on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plot of the merged analysis for control experiments and for control-injured experiments (<a href="#app1-cells-11-02016" class="html-app">Supplementary Figure S1B</a>). This suggested that dataset merging did not lead to a batch effect.</div><div class="html-p">As we were focusing on sticky meningeal cells, we eliminated any suspected doublet cells in the control-injured experiment. Doublets were identified using the DoubletFinder [<a href="#B27-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">27</a>] method guideline with a predicted proportion of 30% of total cells and using ten principal components (PCs). Similar numbers of cells were removed in all experiments, leading to a merged dataset of 1556 cells.</div><div class="html-p">Finally, two datasets were created, a first one for tectum cell heterogeneity analysis with non-injured EGFP-positive brain cells, and a second one for cell recruitment during injured response analysis with non-injured and injured EGFP-positive brain cells.</div></section><section id="sec2dot9-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="html-italic" data-nested="2" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.9. Cluster Identification and Annotation</h4><div class="html-p">Unsupervised clustering was performed with the Seurat FindClusters() function with a resolution of 0.6 for OT cell heterogeneity analysis and a resolution of 1.5 for cell recruitment analysis. UMAP plots were generated with 30 PCA for the first analysis and 20 for the second one according to the Jackstraw analysis. For the second experiment, subsets were generated with control or injured status. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of each cluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers() function.</div></section><section id="sec2dot10-cells-11-02016" type=""><h4 class="html-italic" data-nested="2" style="font-family: Arial, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 2.10. Gene Ontology Analysis</h4><div class="html-p">The Gene Ontology analysis was performed with the Metascape Resource [<a href="#B28-cells-11-02016" class="html-bibr" title="">28</a>]. For the analysis of enriched gene families in pooled cells from the two experiments with control fish, GO terms were identified from the first 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of each cluster with the highest fold-changes of expression levels. For the control-injured analysis, DEGs were sorted into three categories: first, ‘controls’ with FC &gt; 0.25; second, ‘common’ control- and injured-enriched’, both with FC &gt; 0.25 and in addition with a greater enrichment in cells from injured fish than those arising from controls (DeltaFC &gt; 0.25); third, ‘injured-specific’ DEGs were selected if they were present specifically in the injured fish list (FC &gt; 0.25) following a Venn diagram also including the list of genes from control fish cells (FC &gt; 0.25).</div></section></section>
