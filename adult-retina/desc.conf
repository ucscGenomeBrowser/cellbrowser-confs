The retina is a specialized neural tissue that senses light and initiates image
processing. Although the functional organization of specific retina cells has
been well studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in
humans. To comprehensively profile the human retina, we performed single‐cell
RNA sequencing on 20,009 cells from three donors and compiled a reference
transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18
transcriptionally distinct cell populations representing all known neural
retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, Müller glia, bipolar
cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, astrocytes,
and microglia. Our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and putative
early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed the loss of MALAT1
expression with longer post‐mortem time, which potentially suggested a novel
role of MALAT1 in rod photoreceptor degeneration. We have demonstrated the use
of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell‐derived
cone photoreceptors and an adult Müller glia cell line. This work provides an
important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional
landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to understanding retinal
biology and disease.

<section>Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq)</section>
<p>
Single cells from three independent neural retina samples were captured in five
batches using the 10X Chromium system (10X Genomics). The cells were
partitioned into Gel Bead‑In‑Emulsions and barcoded cDNA libraries, then
prepared using the single‐cell 3′ mRNA kit (V2; 10X Genomics). Single‐cell
libraries were sequenced in 100 bp paired‐end configuration using an Illumina
Hi‐Seq 2500 at the Australian Genome Research Facility.
</p>

<section>Bioinformatics processing</section>
<p>
The 10X Genomics cellranger pipeline (version 2.1.0; Zheng et al, 2017) was
used to generate fastq files from raw Illumina BCL files (mkfastq). To generate
read count matrices from the fastq files, we used cellranger count, which uses
the STAR aligner (Dobin et al, 2013), to map high‐quality reads to the
transcriptome (GRCh38), and performs UMI counting. To overcome the stringent
threshold implemented in cellranger that discards real cells under certain
conditions, such as populations of cells with a low RNA content, the
–force‐cells parameter was set to 3,000 for the donor 1 library and 5,000 for
donor 2 and 3 libraries. Using the barcode rank plots produced by cellranger,
these parameters were selected to increase the number of detected cells for
further analysis. The cellranger aggregation function (aggr) was used to
combine the five libraries and normalize the between‐sample library size
differences.
</p>
<p>
Count data were imported into the Seurat single‐cell analysis software (v2.2.1;
https://github.com/satijalab/seurat), and quality control of sequenced
libraries was performed to remove outlier cells and genes. Cells with 200–2,500
detected genes and expressing < 10% mitochondrial genes were retained. Genes
were retained in the data if they were expressed in ≥ 3 cells. Additional
cell–cell normalization was performed using the LogNormalize method, and
inherent variation caused by mitochondrial gene expression and the number of
unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell was regressed out.
</p>
<p>
Clustering at a resolution of 0.6 was performed on PCA‐reduced expression data
for the top 20 principal components using the graph‐based shared nearest
neighbor method (SNN), which calculates the neighborhood overlap (Jaccard
index) between every cell and its nearest neighbors. Clustering results were
visualized using t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t‐SNE).
Individual samples and sample groups were also visualized using t‐SNE.
</p>
<p>
Prediction of the cell cycle phase of individual retinal cells was performed in
Seurat using cell‐cycle‐specific expression data (Kowalczyk et al, 2015).
Briefly, genetic markers associated with G2/M and S phase were used to assign
cell scores, and cells expressing neither of the G2/M or S phase markers were
classified as being in G1 phase.
