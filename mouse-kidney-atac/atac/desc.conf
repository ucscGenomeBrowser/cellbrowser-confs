<section>Single cell ATAC sequencing</section>
<p>
3-week-old and 8-week-old mice were euthanized and perfused with chilled 1x PBS
via left ventricle. Kidneys (0.25 g) were harvested, minced and lysed in 5 mL
lysis buffer for 15 min. 1-day-old mice were decapitated with surgical
scissors, and both kidneys were harvested. Kidneys were minced and lysed in 2
mL lysis buffer for 15 min. Tissue lysis reaction was then blocked by adding 10
mL 1x PBS into each tube, and solution was passed through a 40 μm cell
strainer. Cell debris and cytoplasmic contaminants were removed by Nuclei PURE
Prep Nuclei Isolation Kit (Sigma, NUC-201) after centrifugation at 13,000 RPM
for 45 min. Nuclei concentration was calculated with Countess AutoCounter
(Invitrogen, C10227). Diluted nuclei suspension was loaded and incubated in
transposition mix from Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit (10X
Genomics, PN-1000110) by targeting 10,000 nuclei recovery. GEMs were then
captured on the Chromium Chip E (10x Genomics, PN-1000082) in the Chromium
Controller according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, CG000168).
Libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead
Kit and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit N (10X Genomics, PN-1000084) according to the
manufacturer’s manual. Quality control for constructed library was perform by
Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA kit. The library was sequenced on an
Illumina HiSeq 2×50 paired-end kits using the following read length: 50 bp
Read1 for DNA fragments, 8 bp i7 index for sample index, 16 bp i5 index for
cell barcodes and 50 bp Read2 for DNA fragments.

<h4>snATAC-seq data analysis</h4>
<section>Data processing and quality control</section>
<p>
Raw fastq files were aligned to the mm10 (GRCm38) reference genome and
quantified using Cell Ranger ATAC (v. 1.1.0). We only kept valid barcodes with
number of fragments ranging from 1,000 to 40,000 and mitochondria ratio less
than 10%. One of the important indicators for ATAC-seq data quality is the
fraction of peaks in promoter regions, so we did further filtration based on
promoter ratio. We noticed the promoter ratio seemed to follow a binary
distribution, with most of cells either having a promoter ratio around 5%
(background) or more than 20% (valid cells) (Figure S1d). We therefore filtered
out cells with a promoter ratio <20%. After this stringent quality control, we
obtained 11,429 P0 single cells (5,993 in P0_batch_1 and 5,436 in P0_batch_2)
and 16,887 adult single cells (7,129 in P56_batch_3, 6,397 in P56_batch_4, and
3,361 in P21_batch_5).

<section>Preprocessing</section>
<p>
Since snATAC-seq data are very sparse, previous methods either conducted peak
calling or binarization before clustering. Here, we chose to do binarization
instead of peak calling for two reasons: 1) Peak calling is time consuming; 2)
Many peaks are cell type-specific, open chromatin regions in rare populations
are more likely to be treated as background. After binarizing fragments into 5
kb bins and removing the fragments not matched to chromosomes or aligned to the
mitochondria, we binarized the cell-bin matrix. In order to only keep bins that
were informative for clustering, we removed the top 5% most accessible bins and
bins overlapping with ENCODE blacklist. The 484,606 remaining bins were used as
input for clustering.

<section>Dimension reduction, batch effect correction and clustering</section>
<p>
Clustering was conducted using snapATAC 16, a single-cell ATAC-seq algorithm
scalable to large dataset. Previous benchmarking evaluation has shown that
snapATAC was one of the best-performing methods for snATAC-seq clustering 65.
Diffusion map was applied as a dimension reduction method using function
runDiffusionMaps. To remove batch effect, we used Harmony 17, in which the low
dimensional embeddings obtained from the diffusion map were used as input.
Harmony iteratively pulled batch-specific centroid to cluster centroid until
convergence to remove the variability across batches. After batch correction, a
graph was constructed using k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm with k=15, which
was then used as input for Louvain clustering. We used the first 20 dimensions
for the Louvain algorithm. The number of dimensions was chosen using a method
recommended by snapATAC, although we noticed that the clustering results were
similar among a series of dimensions from 18 to 30.

<section>Cell type annotation</section>
<p>
We used a published list of marker genes 9,19 to annotate kidney cell types. In
order to infer gene expression of each cell type, we built a cell-gene activity
score matrix by integrating all fragments that overlapped with gene transcript.
We used GENCODE Mouse release VM16 22 as reference annotation.
