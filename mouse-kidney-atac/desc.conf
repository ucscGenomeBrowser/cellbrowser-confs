<p>
Determining the epigenetic program that generates unique cell types in the
kidney is critical for understanding cell-type heterogeneity during tissue
homeostasis and injury response.
<p>
Here, we profiled open chromatin and gene expression in developing and adult
mouse kidneys at single cell resolution. We show critical reliance of gene
expression on distal regulatory elements (enhancers). We define key cell
type-specific transcription factors and major gene-regulatory circuits for
kidney cells. Dynamic chromatin and expression changes during nephron
progenitor differentiation demonstrated that podocyte commitment occurs early
and is associated with sustained Foxl1 expression. Renal tubule cells followed
a more complex differentiation, where Hfn4a was associated with proximal and
Tfap2b with distal fate. Mapping single nucleotide variants associated with
human kidney disease identified critical cell types, developmental stages,
genes, and regulatory mechanisms.
