<section>Single cell RNA sequencing of P0 mice</section>
<p>
1-day-old mouse neonate was decapitated with surgical scissors, 2 kidneys were
harvested and minced into 1 mm3 pieces and incubated with digestion solution
containing Enzyme D, Enzyme R and Enzyme A from Multi Tissue Dissociation Kit
(Miltenyi, 130-110-201) at 37 °C for 15 min with agitation. Reaction was
deactivated by adding 10% FBS, then solution was passed through a 40 μm cell
strainer. After centrifugation at 1,000 RPM for 5 min, cell pellet was
incubated with 500 μL of RBC lysis buffer on ice for 3 min. We centrifuged the
cells at 1,000 RPM for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended the cells in the buffer
for further steps. Cell number and viability were analyzed using Countess
AutoCounter (Invitrogen, C10227). The cell concentration was 2.2 million
cells/mL with 92% viability. 10,000 cells were loaded into the Chromium
Controller (10X Genomics, PN-120223) on a Chromium Single Cell B Chip (10X
Genomics, PN-120262) and processed to generate single cell gel beads in the
emulsion (GEM) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics,
CG000183). The library was generated using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent
Kits v3 (10X Genomics, PN-1000092) and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (10X Genomics,
PN-120262) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Quality control for
constructed library was performed by Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA
kit (Agilent Technologies, 5067-4626) for qualitative analysis. Quantification
analysis was performed by Illumina Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems,
KK4824). The library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq or NextSeq 2×150
paired-end kits using the following read length: 28 bp Read1 for cell barcode
and UMI, 8 bp I7 index for sample index and 91 bp Read2 for transcript.

<h4>Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis</h4>
<section>Alignment and quality control</section>
<p>
Raw fastq files were aligned to the mm10 (Ensembl GRCm38.93) reference genome
and quantified using CellRanger v3.1.0. Seurat R package v3.0 was used for data
quality control, preprocessing and dimensional reduction analysis. After
gene-cell data matrix generation of both P0 and adult datasets, matrices were
merged and poor-quality cells with <200 or >3,000 expressed genes and
mitochondrial gene percentages >50 were excluded, leaving 25,138 P0 and 18,498
adult cells for further analytical processing, respectively (Figures S1j-k).

<section>Pre-processing, batch effect correction and dimension reduction</section>
<p>
Data were normalized by RPM following log transformation and 3,000 highly
variable genes were selected for scaling and principal component analysis
(PCA). Harmony R package v1.0 17 was used to correct batch effects. The top 20
dimensions of Harmony embeddings were used for downstream uniform manifold
approximation and projection (UMAP) visualization and clustering (Figures
S1l-m).

<section>Cell clustering, identification of marker genes and differentially expressed genes</section>
<p>
Louvain algorithm with resolution 0.4 was used to cluster cells, which resulted
in 18 distinct cell clusters. A gene was considered to be differentially
expressed if it was detected in at least 25% of one group and with at least
0.25 log fold change between two groups and the significant level of
BH-adjusted p value <0.05 in Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. We used a list of
marker genes 9,19 to manually annotate cell types. 2 distal convoluted tubule
clusters were merged based on the marker gene expression, resulting in a total
of 17 clusters (Figures S1i, n, o).
