To create a proxy for gene expression, ATACseq fragments in the gene-body plus
promoter (2Kb upstream from transcription start sites) of all protein-coding
genes were summed for each cell to generate ‘Gene Activity Scores’. A matrix
was constructed for all gene activity scores by all cells. Due to the sparsity
of scATAC-seq data, the MAGIC imputation method was used to impute gene
activity scores based on the K-nearest neighbor graph.
