Early human embryonic development involves extensive lineage diversification,
cell-fate specification and tissue patterning. Despite its basic and clinical
importance, early human embryonic development remains relatively unexplained
owing to interspecies divergence and limited accessibility to human embryo
samples. Here we report that human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a
microfluidic device recapitulate, in a highly controllable and scalable
fashion, landmarks of the development of the epiblast and amniotic ectoderm
parts of the conceptus, including lumenogenesis of the epiblast and the
resultant pro-amniotic cavity, formation of a bipolar embryonic sac, and
specification of primordial germ cells and primitive streak cells. We further
show that amniotic ectoderm-like cells function as a signalling centre to
trigger the onset of gastrulation-like events in hPSCs. Given its
controllability and scalability, the microfluidic model provides a powerful
experimental system to advance knowledge of human embryology and reproduction.
This model could assist in the rational design of differentiation protocols of
hPSCs for disease modelling and cell therapy, and in high-throughput drug and
toxicity screens to prevent pregnancy failure and birth defects.

<section>scRNA-seq and data analysis</section>
<p>
P-ELS at t = 48 h were treated with Accutase for 1 h to obtain single-cell
suspensions. Cells from six microfluidic devices were collected and pooled into
PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Transwell-AMLCs were obtained by treating human ES
cells with BMP4 (50 ng ml−1) for 48 h using the Transwell method.
Transwell-AMLCs were treated with Accutase for 1 h to obtain single-cell
suspensions. human ES cells maintained on standard tissue culture plates were
dissociated into single cells using Accutase for 1 h. Transwell-AMLCs and human
ES cells were counted before being mixed at a 2:1 ratio as a single-cell
suspension. Within 1 h after cell dissociation, cells were loaded into the 10x
Genomics Chromium system. 10x Genomics v.2 libraries were prepared according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were then sequenced with a minimum
coverage of 50,000 raw reads per cell on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 with paired-end
sequencing. scRNA-seq data were aligned and quantified using Cell Ranger
Single-Cell Software Suite (v.3.0.0, 10x Genomics) against the hg19 human
reference genome.</p>

<p>
Merging of scRNA-seq data and cell clustering was performed using the Seurat R
package (v.3.0.0.9)36,37. Default setups were used unless noted otherwise. In
brief, cells with nfeature_RNA &leq; 3,200 or &geq; 6,200 (P-ELS), nfeature_RNA &leq; 3,600
or &geq; 6,400 (Transwell-AMLC and human ES cell), or cells in which the total
mitochondrial gene expression exceeded 6% of total gene expression were
discarded from analysis. Gene expression was calculated by normalizing the raw
count by the total count before being multiplied by 10,000 and log-transformed.
After cell-cycle regression, principal component analysis was performed using
the RunPCA function in Seurat. Identification of cell clusters by a shared
nearest neighbour (SNN) modularity optimization based clustering algorithm was
achieved using the FindClusters function with a resolution set at 0.3.
Dimensionality reduction using t- SNE was generated using RunTSNE (dim =
1:15).</p>

<p>
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using FindAllMarkers,
with a minimal fold difference of 0.25 in the logarithmic scale and >25%
detection rate in either of the two cell types under comparison. Violin plots
were generated using VlnPlot in the Seurat R package. Heat maps were plotted on
the basis of relative expression (Z-score) of top-20 gene signatures to
distinguish each cell cluster. GO analyses were performed using DAVID
Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 on the basis of DEGs (Supplementary Table 1). For
comparison with published data, gene expression data obtained from different
platforms (GEO repository, NCBI) were first transformed into log2(reads per
million mapped reads (RPM) + 1). Average expression level of each cell type was
used for calculation of correlation coefficient and heat map plotting.</p>
