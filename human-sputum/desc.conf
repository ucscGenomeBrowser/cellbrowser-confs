<p>
Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, multisystem hereditary
disease caused by abnormal chloride transport. CF lung disease is driven by
innate immune dysfunction and exaggerated inflammatory responses that
contribute to tissue injury. To define the transcriptional profile of this
airway immune dysfunction, we performed the first single-cell transcriptome
characterization of CF sputum.
<p>
Objectives: To define the transcriptional profile of sputum cells and its
implication in the pathogenesis of immune function and the development of CF
lung disease."""

<p>
We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of sputum cells from nine subjects with
cystic fibrosis (CF) and five healthy control (CTRL) subjects. We applied novel 
computational approaches to define expression-based cell function and maturity 
profiles, herein called transcriptional archetypes.

<section>Single Cell Barcoding, Library Preparation, and Sequencing</section>
<p>
Single cells were barcoded using the 10x Chromium Single Cell platform, and cDNA libraries
were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3, 10x
Genomics, USA). In brief, cell suspensions, reverse transcription master mix and partitioning oil
were loaded on a single cell “B” chip, then run on the Chromium Controller. mRNA was reverse
transcribed within the droplets at 53°C for 45min. cDNA was amplified for a 12 cycles total on a
BioRad C1000 Touch thermocycler. cDNA was size-selected using SpriSelect beads (Beckman
Coulter, USA) with a ratio of SpriSelect reagent volume to sample volume of 0.6. For qualitative
control purposes, cDNA was analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip.
cDNA was fragmented using the proprietary fragmentation enzyme blend for 5min at 32°C,
followed by end repair and A-tailing at 65°C for 30min. cDNA were double-sided size selected
using SpriSelect beads. Sequencing adaptors were ligated to the cDNA at 20°C for 15min.
cDNA was amplified using a sample-specific index oligo as primer, followed by another round
of double-sided size selection using SpriSelect beads. For qualitative control purposes, final
libraries were analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip. cDNA libraries
were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 Illumina platform aiming for 150 million reads per library. Full
de-identified sequencing data for all subjects is available in the gene expression omnibus (GEO)
under accession number GSE145360. """
