Several studies show that the immunosuppressive drugs targeting the
interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, including tocilizumab, ameliorate lethal
inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, by
employing single-cell analysis of the immune cell composition of two
severe-stage COVID-19 patients prior to and following tocilizumab-induced
remission, we identify a monocyte subpopulation that contributes to the
inflammatory cytokine storms. Furthermore, although tocilizumab treatment
attenuates the inflammation, immune cells, including plasma B cells and CD8+ T
cells, still exhibit robust humoral and cellular antiviral immune responses.
Thus, in addition to providing a high-dimensional dataset on the immune cell
distribution at multiple stages of the COVID-19, our work also provides
insights into the therapeutic effects of tocilizumab, and identifies potential
target cell populations for treating COVID-19-related cytokine storms.

<section>Human samples</section>
<p>
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from two severe COVID-19 patients.
Patient severity was defined according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of
COVID-19 (Trial Version 6) which was released by The General Office of the
National Health Commission and the Office of the National Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine. Patient P1 was defined as a severe patient
because his peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2) was <93% without a
nasal catheter supplying oxygen. Patient P2 was defined as having critical
illness due to respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction (MOD), and a
SPO2 < 93 without a nasal catheter supplying oxygen. Two peripheral blood
samples were obtained from patient P1 on day 1 and day 5, and three peripheral
blood samples were obtained from patient P2 on day 1, day 5, and day 7. For
both patients, the peripheral blood samples for day 1 were collected within
12 h of tocilizumab administration, when the patients were still in the severe
stage. Our decision to obtain blood from the two patients on day 5 was guided
by information from the authors of the recent study published in PNAS, which
prompted our decision to consider day 5 of tocilizumab treatment as the
beginning of the remission stage. For patient P2, we observed that a SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid test of a throat swab specimen was still positive on day 5, so we
performed another blood draw on day 7 for P2, at which point the throat swab
specimen nucleic acid test was negative. All samples were collected from the
First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China.
Before the blood draws, informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the First Affiliated
Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China (No.
2020-XG(H)-020).

<section>Single-cell RNA-seq</section>
<p>
We generated single-cell transcriptome libraries by following the instructions
of the single-cell 3′ solution v2 reagent kit (10X Genomics). Briefly, after
thawing, washing, and counting cells, we loaded the cell suspensions onto a
chromium single-cell chip along with partitioning oil, reverse transcription
(RT) reagents, and a collection of gel beads that contained 3,500,000 unique
10X barcodes. After the generation of single-cell gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs),
RT was performed using a C1000 TouchTM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). The amplified
cDNA was purified with SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter). Single-cell
libraries were then constructed following fragmentation, end repair, polyA
tailing, adaptor ligation, and size selection based on the manufacturer’s
standard parameters. Each sequencing library was generated with a unique sample
index. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system.

<section>Single-cell RNA-seq data processing</section>
<p>
The raw sequencing data of patients and healthy donors were processed using
Cell Ranger (version 3.1.0) against the GRCh38 human reference genome with
default parameters, and data from different patients and disease stages were
combined with the Cell Ranger aggr function. We have uploaded the scRNA-seq
data of the PBMCs from the two severe COVID-19 patients to the Genome Sequence
Archive for Human (GSA-Human) at the BIG Data Centre. We also used the
scRNA-seq data of PBMCs from two healthy donors, which can be downloaded from
the 10X genomics official website. First, we filtered low-quality cells using
Seurat (version 3.1.4). For cells from COVID-19 patients (P1 and P2), we
retained cells with detected gene numbers between 500 and 6000 and less than
10% mitochondrial unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). For cells from healthy
donors, we retained cells with detected gene numbers between 300 and 5000 and
less than 10% mitochondrial UMIs. Subsequently, we used Scrublet (version
0.2.1) to eliminate doublets among the PBMCs from the COVID-19 patients and
healthy donors. We used the default parameters for Scrublet (i.e., Eq.
min_gene_variability_pctl = 85, n_prin_comps = 30, threshold = 0.25) and
detected 50 doublets in the patients and 997 doublets in the healthy donors.
After removing the doublets, we normalized the gene counts for each cell using
the NormalizeData function of Seurat with the default parameters.
<p>
For the downstream data processing, we used canonical correlation analysis and
the top 40 canonical components to identify the anchor cells in patients and
healthy controls. We then used the IntegrateData function in Seurat to
integrate the cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. We clustered
all the cells based on the integrated gene expression matrix using Seurat with
a parameter Resolution=0.3 and generated 20 clusters. To display the cells in a
two-dimensional space, we performed principal component analysis on the
integrated dataset and used the first 50 principal components (PCs) for uniform
manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis.
<p>
In the integration of cells from COVID-19 and sepsis patients using Seurat, we
applied the same functions and parameters as those described above. We used
Seurat to cluster the integrated gene expression matrix (with a resolution =
0.3) and identified monocyte clusters based on the expression of the known
marker genes CD14 and CD68. We then extracted all monocytes from the integrated
dataset and reclustered them. Finally, we generated 10 cell clusters.
