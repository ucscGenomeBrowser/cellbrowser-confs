The lipidome is currently understudied but fundamental to life.
Within the brain, little is known about cell-type lipid heterogeneity, and even
less is known about cell-to-cell heterogeneity because it is difficult to study
the lipids within individual cells. Here, we developed single cell mass
spectrometry-based protocols, to profile the lipidomes of 154,000 single-cells
across ten individuals consisting of five developmental ages, and five brain
regions, resulting in a unique lipid atlas of the developing human brain. We
created lipid profiles of several major cell types and detected lipids that
change as a function of brain region and developmental age.

<section>MS Analysis</section>
<p>
microMS was used as previously described 22. Briefly, cells were filtered by size,
shape and distance to reduce time spent analyzing debris and artifacts from cell sampling.
microMS was used to register microscopy images with the MALDI MS stage. After full-slide
imaging was performed, slides were coated with a 50 mg/mL DHB solution dissolved in 1:1
ethanol:water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as described previously 9 . The total amount of matrix
applied was between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/cm 2 . Single cell analysis was performed on an
ultrafleXtreme TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Corp.) with a mass window of 500–3000.
The “Ultra” (~100 µm footprint) laser setting was used and 300 laser shots were accumulated at
1000 Hz and 60% laser energy for each cell. Lipid extracts of select samples were prepared
using the Bligh-Dyer method 23 . Direct infusion electrospray ionization of lipid extract (~1 mg of
dried extract was resuspended in 1 mL of 50:50 methanol and water) was performed for high
mass accuracy of selected lipids using a solariX XR 7T Fourier-transform ion cyclotron
resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (Bruker Corp.) with a mass window of m/z 100–3000.
Sample was delivered at 120 µl/h with a capillary voltage of 3900 V. Extract spectra were
recalibrated using [PC(32:0)+H] + , [PC(32:0)+Na] + , [PC(38:4)+H] + .

<section>Data Normalization and Lipid Identification</section>
<p>
Spectra were total ion current normalized and
aligned using [PC(32:0)+H] + , which was present in most of the single cells. Lipids were
putatively identified using a combination of high mass accuracy FTICR MS and LIPIDMAPS
database searching [10.1021/ed200088u, 10.1093/nar/gkm324] using &gt; 3 ppm errors as a cut
off. The m/z values obtained from the ultrafleXtreme were mass matched to the closest identity.

<section>Clustering</section>
<p>
Clustering was performed using Louvain-Jaccard graph-based clustering.
Normalized matrices were used for downstream analysis without additional transformation.
Variable genes were identified based upon default parameters in Seurat version 2. In the space
of these variable genes, principal component analysis was performed, and significant principal
components were identified based upon previously described methods 24. The 10 nearest
neighbors of each individual cell were identified based upon the projection of these principal
components with the RANN R package (CRAN), and the Jaccard distance was calculated
between all nearest neighbors, expanding distance between only slightly similar cells and
decreasing the distances between similar cells. Clusters were determined with the igraph R
package (https://igraph.org/) using Louvain clustering, and differential spectra were identified
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

<section>Cell Type Annotation</section>
<p>
Cell type annotations were used by comparing identifiable lipids
between each individual cell in our dataset and previously published 9 cell-type-specific lipid
profiles. If more than 70% of the lipid profile matched, it was assigned as either astrocyte or
neuron, but if the match for either cell type was less than this, it was labelled as other.
