Despite its relevance for health and disease, little is known about human brain
vascular development. Using confocal and electron microscopy,
fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we
characterized 147,228 brain endothelial and mural cells in the second
trimester. Trajectory analysis of endothelial cells correlated with their
staging in the mouse brain and followed venous/capillary cells to arterial and
tip cell subtypes. The stages of mural cell development were previously
undescribed; we show progression from more immature smooth muscle cells to
classic pericytes and fibroblasts. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed
abundant ECM components and emerging junction proteins consistent with an
immature blood brain barrier. Functionally, human endothelial and mural cells
transplanted into cortical organoids display an angiogenic phenotype, promote
neurogenesis, and decrease cell stress. In sum, our results lay the foundation
to understand human brain vascular development and will serve as a powerful
resource to interrogate neurovascular interactions.

To prepare the cells for FACS, the tissue is first minced with a scalpel and then digested with
collagenase/dispase. A Percoll step follows to eliminate debris. Single cell suspensions are
incubated with the following fluorescently labeled antibodies: CD31-FITC for endothelial cells,
CD146-PE for mural cells (high) and radial glia (low), and CD45-PECy7 to exclude microglia
and blood cells. The FACS gating strategy first eliminated debris, dead cells, and doublets. After
excluding blood cells and microglia, we then obtained distinct populations of endothelial and
mural cells. The FACS-purified cells were sequenced at the UCSF Genomics center using an
Illumina NovaSeq sequencing system. Following the bioinformatic pipeline established in the
Kriegstein lab for scRNA-seq analysis (Nowakowski, T. J. et al Science 2017; Velmeshev, D. et
al Science 2019; Pollen, A. A. et al Cell 2019), cells were aligned using the cellRanger pipeline
to identify live cells with &gt;500 genes per cell and &lt;10% mitochondrial reads. We used Louvain-
Jaccard clustering to maximize the similarities between like cells and amplify the distance
between dissimilar cells. With this approach, we over-clustered the data and then combined cell
types with few or no differentially expressed genes to ensure that even the rarest cell types in
each population were found. This clustering enabled us to identify specific markers for each cell
type, and these markers were used for validation. t-SNE and uMAP based visualizations, violin
plots, and feature plots were generated with the Seurat package."""
