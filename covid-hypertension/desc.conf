In COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have emerged as major
risk factors for critical disease progression. Concurrently, the impact of the
main anti-hypertensive therapies, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), on COVID-19 severity is
controversially discussed. By combining clinical data, single-cell sequencing
data of airway samples and in vitro experiments, we assessed the cellular and
pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 driven by cardiovascular disease and its
treatment options. Anti-hypertensive ACEi or ARB therapy, was not associated
with an altered expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in nasopharyngeal
epithelial cells and thus presumably does not change susceptibility for
SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we observed a more critical progress in COVID-19
patients with hypertension associated with a distinct inflammatory
predisposition of immune cells. While ACEi treatment was associated with
dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and intrinsic anti-viral responses,
under ARB treatment enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions were observed.
Macrophages and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and
cardiovascular comorbidities, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited
higher expression of CCL3, CCL4, and its receptor CCR1, which associated with
critical COVID-19 progression. Overall, these results provide a potential
explanation for the adverse COVID-19 course in patients with cardiovascular
disease, i.e. an augmented immune response in critical cells for the disease
course, and might suggest a beneficial effect of clinical ACEi treatment in
hypertensive COVID-patients

<section>Isolation and preparation of single cells from human airway specimens, followed
by pre-processing of the raw sequencing reads</section>
<p>
Sample procurement, single-cell isolation, library preparation, and subsequent data
analysis was performed as described previously. Briefly, freshly taken
nasopharyngeal swabs from donors were directly transferred into 500 μL cold
DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, 11039) and 500 μL of 13mM DTT (AppliChem, A2948)
were added to each sample. Cells were released by gently pipetting the solution onto
the swab, followed by dipping the swab 20 times into the medium. Subsequently, the
samples were incubated on a thermomixer at 37°C, 500 rpm for 10 minutes, followed
by centrifugation at 350xG at 4°C for 5 minutes. While carefully removing the
supernatant, the pellet was visually examined for any traces of blood. If it contained
red blood cells (RBC), the pellet was resuspended in 500 μL 1x PBS (Sigma-Aldrich,
D8537) and 1 mL of RBC Lysis Buffer (Roche, 11814389001), incubated at 25°C for
10 minutes, and subsequently centrifuged at 350xG at 4°C for 5 minutes. A single cell
suspension was achieved by resuspending the cell pellet in 500 μL Accutase (Thermo
Fisher, 00-4555-56), followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes with
gently mixing the cells after 5 minutes by pipetting. Subsequently, 500 μL DMEM/F12
supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the cells. After centrifugation at 350xG at
4°C for 5 minutes and removal of the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in
100-500 μL 1x PBS (depending on the size of the cell pellet). Cell debris was removed
by using a 35 μm cell strainer (Falcon, 352235) before cell counting was performed
using a disposable Neubauer chamber (NanoEnTek, DHC-N01). The cell suspension
was loaded into the 10x Chromium Controller using the 10x Genomics Single Cell 3’
Library Kit v3.0 (10x Genomics; PN 1000076; PN 1000077; PN 1000078) and 10x
Genomics Single Cell 3 ́ Library Kit v3.1 (10x Genomics; PN 1000223; PN 1000157;
PN 1000213; PN 1000122) and the subsequent reverse transcription, cDNA
amplification, and library preparation was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Importantly, we extended the incubation at 85°C during the reverse
transcription to 10 minutes to ensure virus inactivation. Afterwards, the 3’RNA
sequencing libraries were pooled either for S2 or S4 flow cells (S2: up to eight samples,
S4: up to 20 samples) and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System
(Illumina, paired-end, single-indexing).
All samples were processed under biosafety S3 within one hour after procurement.
Note that samples not immediately used for library preparation were resuspended in
cryopreservation medium [20% FBS (Gibco, 10500), 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich,
D8418), 70% DMEM/F12] and stored at -80°C. Frozen cells were thawed quickly at
37°C, pelleted at 350xG at 4°C for 5 minutes, and proceeded with normal processing.
Single-cell datasets were processed using cellranger 3.0.1. All transcripts were aligned
to a customized human hg19 reference genome (10x genomics, version 3.1.0) plus
the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Refseq-ID: NC_045512) added as an additional
chromosome. Following alignment, ambient RNA was removed using SoupX39 11 using
MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC5B as marker genes. Where ambient RNA levels seemed
plausible (5-15%), filtered expression matrices were used for downstream analyses.
Further processing was performed using Seurat 3.1.4. Genes were retained if they
were present in at least three cells in a sample. Cells with more than or equal to 15%
mitochondrial reads or less than 200 genes expressed were removed from the
analysis. For the number of UMIs, an upper cutoff was chosen manually per sample
based on outliers in a UMI counts vs. gene counts plot and was typically in the range
of 75,000 to 150,000. After normalizing to 10,000 reads per cell, samples were
integrated using stepwise CCA on smaller subsets using 90 components and 2,000
variable genes identified by SelectIntegrationFeatures. On the integrated dataset, PCA
was run using 90 principal components, followed by UMAP and clustering with a
resolution of 2.1, both using all components. NKT, CTL, and p-NKT cells were
subsetted for further analysis. Scaling, dimensional reduction by PCA and the UMAP
was calculated separately for this subset.
Cell types were then refined manually by assessing the expression of known cell type
markers. Cell types from epithelial and immune cell populations were identified
according to the expression levels of different marker genes (Extended Data Figure
1c). The “viral responsive” cell states of ciliated and squamous epithelial cells
(Extended Data Figure 1b) were identified by gene set enrichment analysis using
clusterProfiler version 3.12.0 and the output of “FindClusters()” function from Seurat
as input (https://yulab-smu.github.io/clusterProfiler-book/index.html).
For cell-cell interactions, which are based on the expression of known ligand-receptor
pairs in different identified cell types, CellPhoneDB 9 version 2.1.2 was used
(https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb). circlize 0.4.10 was used to generate the
circos plots to display the cell-cell interactions.
Shifts of interactions across the different conditions were tested for significance using
a logistic regression based on a binomial distribution (Supplementary Table 5).
Arboreto 0.1.5 and pySCENIC 0.10.0 were used to infer transcription factor
importance.
