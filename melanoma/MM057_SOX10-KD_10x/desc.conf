abstract = """siRNA knock-down of the melanocytic lineage factor
SOX10 in the patient-derived cell line MM057, measured with 10x. We
sampled cells without treatment (BL), after 72h with a no-template
control (NTC), after 24h, 48h and 72h of SOX10 knock-down, respectively,
and a mixture of cells at ten time points between between 2 and 32 hours
of knock-down (TL).
