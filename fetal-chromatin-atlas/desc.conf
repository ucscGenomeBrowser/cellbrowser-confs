The chromatin landscape underlying the specification of human cell types is of
fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of chromatin
accessibility and gene expression in fetal tissues. For chromatin
accessibility, we devised a three-level combinatorial indexing assay and
applied it to 53 samples representing 15 organs, profiling ~800,000 single
cells. We leveraged cell types defined by gene expression to annotate these
data and cataloged hundreds of thousands of candidate regulatory elements that
exhibit cell type–specific chromatin accessibility. We investigated the
properties of lineage-specific transcription factors (such as POU2F1 in
neurons), organ-specific specializations of broadly distributed cell types
(such as blood and endothelial), and cell type–specific enrichments of complex
trait heritability. These data represent a rich resource for the exploration of
in vivo human gene regulation in diverse tissues and cell types.

<section>Data processing for sci-ATAC-seq3</section>
<p>
Cell barcodes were separated from the distribution of background barcodes by
fitting a mixture of two negative binomials (noise versus signal). Nonduplicate
fragment endpoints for each cell were used for peak calling in each sample by
use of MACS2 (101). Peak calls from all samples included in downstream analysis
were merged to form a master set of peaks. For each sample, we created sparse
matrices counting (i) reads falling within the master set of peaks and (ii)
reads falling within gene bodies extended by 2 kb upstream for each cell. We
additionally tabulated the total number of reads from each cell coming from
annotated TSSs (±1 kb around each TSS), ENCODE blacklist regions, and our set
of merged peaks for quality control (QC) purposes. To filter out low-quality
cells, we chose tissue-specific cut-offs for the fraction of nonduplicate reads
in peaks (minimums ranging from 20 to 40%) and the fraction of nonduplicate
reads falling in TSSs (minimums ranging from 5 to 15%) by means of visual
inspection of their distributions for each sample (for example, for some
tissues we observed a bimodal distribution for the fraction of nonduplicate
reads in peaks and removed the lower mode), and a global cutoff of 0.5% of
nonduplicate reads coming from ENCODE blacklist regions. All downstream steps
were performed one tissue at a time by pooling cells passing QC from all
samples of a given tissue. We used a modified version of the scrublet (102)
algorithm to remove the cells most likely to be doublets.

<section>Dimensionality reduction and clustering</section>
<p>
For dimensionality reduction, we found that the implementation of latent
semantic indexing [LSI; or equivalently, latent semantic analysis (LSA)] that
we have previously applied (13) did not perform well on data collected in this
study, likely owing to sparsity. Log-scaling the term-frequency term in LSI
resulted in very similar performance to those of the other tools we tested
(103, 104). We suspect that this is due to the exponential distribution of
total counts per cell and the impact of strong outliers on the principal
components analysis (PCA) step of LSI in the absence of log scaling.
<p>
We performed LSI on the binarized peak-by-cell matrix for all cells passing QC
from each tissue, one tissue at a time. We first weighted all the sites for
individual cells by log(total number of peaks accessible in cell) (log-scaled
“term frequency”). We then multiplied these weighted values by log(1 + the
inverse frequency of each site across all cells), the “inverse document
frequency.” We used singular value decomposition on the term frequency–inverse
document frequency matrix to generate a lower-dimensional representation of the
data (PCA) by only retaining the 2nd through 50th dimensions (the first
dimension tends to be highly correlated with read depth). L2 normalization was
performed on the PCA matrix to further account for differences in the number of
nonduplicate fragments per cell. This L2-normalized PCA matrix was used for all
downstream steps.
<p>
Although we did not observe evidence for substantial batch effects between
samples, we nonetheless applied the Harmony batch correction algorithm on the
PCA space to correct batch effects between different samples (20, 21). This
corrected L2-normalized PCA space was used as input to Louvain clustering and
UMAP as implemented in Seurat V3 (105).

<section>Cell type annotation</section>
<p>
To transfer cell type labels for our Louvain clusters from the companion
sci-RNA-seq data, we used an NNLS-based cluster-by-cluster annotation approach,
which we have implemented previously to transfer labels between single-cell
RNA-seq datasets (26). Briefly, we predicted the gene expression of target cell
type in dataset A with the gene expression of all cell types in dataset B, and
vice versa, and then multiplied the resulting βs to determine the matching of
cell types between the two data sets with high specificity. To calculate gene
level accessibility scores from ATAC data, we summed the accessibility over
gene bodies extended by 2 kb upstream of their TSS. In addition to determining
the NNLS score for each cell type or cluster, accessibility close to known cell
type marker genes [described in (16)] was inspected for each cluster in each
tissue (summed over all cells in that cluster). Clusters that had a high score
in the NNLS and/or clear specific accessibility at matching marker genes were
annotated accordingly. Clusters without strong NNLS signal and weaker or less
specific marker gene accessibility received a less confident annotation.
Clusters with no NNLS signal and no or only uninformative marker gene
expression were left unannotated. In some cases, several Louvain clusters
received the same cell type annotation within a tissue and were merged
accordingly for downstream analyses.
