During pancreatic development, endocrine cells appear from the pancreatic
epithelium when Neurog3-positive cells delaminate and differentiate into α-,
β-, γ- and δ-cells. The mechanisms involved in this process are still
incompletely understood. We characterized the temporal, lineage-specific
developmental programs during pancreatic development by sequencing the
transcriptome of thousands of individual pancreatic cells from E12.5 to E18.5
in mice, and identified all known cell types that are present in the embryonic
pancreas, but focused specifically on α- and β-cell differentiation by
enrichment of a MIP-GFP reporter. We characterized transcriptomic heterogeneity
in the tip domain based on proliferation, and characterized two endocrine
precursor clusters marked by expression of Neurog3 and Fev Pseudotime analysis
revealed specific branches for developing α- and β-cells, which allowed
identification of specific gene regulation patterns. These include some known
and many previously unreported genes that appear to define pancreatic cell fate
transitions. This resource allows dynamic profiling of embryonic pancreas
development at single cell resolution and reveals novel gene signatures during
pancreatic differentiation into α- and β-cells.

<section>Data processing</section>
<p>
Cells with fewer than 6000 UMI counts and/or cells that expressed fewer than
2000 genes were filtered from the dataset. Data were processed in R using
Seurat version 2.3.4 as follows: metadata were added regarding the origin of
the cell (experimental code, embryonic age, live or GFP sorted). Then data were
log-normalized with a scaling factor of 10,000. Variable genes were detected
using an x low cut-off of 0.2 and a y low cut-off of 0.5, with high cut-offs
set to infinity and data divided into 20 bins. All genes were scaled using a
negative binomial model assuming UMI data, with the number of expressed UMIs
and genes per cell were used as variables to regress. A total of 40 principal
components were calculated and assessed using jackstraw. All PCs were found to
contribute significantly and were thus used for downstream analysis. Clustering
was performed using Seurats FindClusters function with sensitivities ranging
from 0.1 to 2 in 0.1 steps. Using clustree version 0.3.0, it was first observed
on a sensitivity resolution of 0.5 that clustering was not changed at a higher
sensitivity, and this sensitivity was then picked for assessment of clustering
using the AssessNodes function of Seurat after building a clustering tree of
the clustering. Nodes that had a higher out-of-bag error rate than 10% were
removed and clusters underneath these nodes were merged. UMAP dimensional
reduction was calculated using the umap package version 0.1.0.3, with metric
function set to euclidean and using only variable genes, as detected by Seurat.
