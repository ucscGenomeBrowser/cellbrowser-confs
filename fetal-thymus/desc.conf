The thymus provides a nurturing environment for the differentiation and
selection of T cells, a process orchestrated by their interaction with multiple
thymic cell types. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a cell census
of the human thymus across the life span and to reconstruct T cell
differentiation trajectories and T cell receptor (TCR) recombination kinetics.
Using this approach, we identified and located in situ CD8αα+ T cell
populations, thymic fibroblast subtypes, and activated dendritic cell states.
In addition, we reveal a bias in TCR recombination and selection, which is
attributed to genomic position and the kinetics of lineage commitment. Taken
together, our data provide a comprehensive atlas of the human thymus across the
life span with new insights into human T cell development.

<section>Single-cell RNA sequencing experiment</section>
<p>
For FACS sorting of isolated thymus cells, dissociated cells were stained with
a panel of antibodies prior to sorting based on CD45 or CD3 expression gate.
Enrichment of EpCAM-positive cells was performed using CD326 (EpCAM) microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec, 130-061-101) according to manufacturer’s protocol. CD45
depleted cells were obtained using CD45 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec,
130-045-801) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Cell number and viability
were checked after the enrichment to ensure that no significant cell death has
been caused by the process.
</p>
<p>
For the droplet-encapsulation scRNA-seq experiments, 8000 live, single, CD45+
or CD45– FACS-isolated cells or MACS-enriched cells were loaded on to each of
the Chromium Controller (10x Genomics). Single-cell cDNA synthesis,
amplification, and sequencing libraries were generated using the Single Cell 3′
and 5′ Reagent Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries
from up to eight loaded channels were multiplexed together and sequenced on an
Illumina HiSeq 4000. The libraries were distributed over eight lanes per flow
cell and sequenced using the following parameters: Read1: 26 cycles, i7: 8
cycles, i5: 0 cycles; Read2: 98 cycles to generate 75-bp paired-end reads. For
the plate-based scRNA-seq experiments, a slightly modified Smart-Seq2 protocol
was used. After cDNA generation, libraries were prepared (384 cells per
library) using the Illumina Nextera XT kit. Index v2 sets A, B, C, and D were
used per library to barcode each cell for multiplexing. Each library was
sequenced (384 cells) per lane at a sequencing depth of 1 to 2 million reads
per cell on HiSeq 4000 using v4 SBS chemistry to create 75-bp paired-end reads.

<section>Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis</section>
<p>
Droplet-based sequencing data were aligned and quantified using the Cell Ranger
Single-Cell Software Suite (version 2.0.2 for 3′ chemistry and version 2.1.0
for 5′ chemistry, 10x Genomics Inc.) using the GRCh38 human reference genome
(official Cell Ranger reference, version 1.2.0). Cells with fewer than 2000 UMI
counts and 500 detected genes were considered as empty droplets and removed
from the dataset. Cells with more than 7000 detected genes were considered as
potential doublets and removed from the dataset.
</p>
<p>
Smart-seq2 sequencing data were aligned with STAR (version 2.5.1b), using the
STAR index and annotation from the same reference as the 10x data.
Gene-specific read counts were calculated using htseq-count (version 0.10.0).
Scanpy (version 1.3.4) python package was used to load the cell-gene count
matrix and perform downstream analysis. Doublet detection, clustering,
annotation, batch alignment, trajectory analysis, cell-cell interaction, and
repertoire analysis is performed using the tools in Scanpy package complemented
with some custom codes.
