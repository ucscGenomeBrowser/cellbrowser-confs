The cerebral cortex is a cellularly-complex structure comprised of a rich
diversity of neuronal and glial cell types. Cortical neurons can be broadly
categorized into two classes—glutamatergic excitatory neurons and GABAergic
inhibitory interneurons. Previous developmental studies in rodents have led to
the prevailing model that while excitatory neurons are born from progenitors
located in the cortex, cortical interneurons are born from a separate
population of progenitors located outside of the developing cortex in the
ganglionic eminences1-5. However, the developmental potential of human cortical
progenitors has not been thoroughly explored. Here we show that in addition to
excitatory neurons and glia, human cortical progenitors are also capable of
producing GABAergic neurons with the transcriptional characteristics and
morphologies of cortical interneurons. By developing a cellular barcoding tool
called “ScRNAseq-compatible Tracer for Identifying Clonal Relationships”
(STICR), we were able to perform clonal lineage tracing of 1912 primary human
cortical progenitors from six specimens and capture both the transcriptional
identities and clonal relationships of their resulting progeny. A subpopulation
of cortically-born GABAergic neurons were transcriptionally similar to cortical
interneurons born from the caudal ganglionic eminence and these cells were
frequently related to excitatory neurons and glia.  Thus, our results
demonstrate that individual human cortical progenitors can generate both
excitatory neurons and cortical interneurons, providing a new framework for
understanding the origins of neuronal diversity in the human cortex.

methods = """
10X transcriptomic libraries were aligned to the hg38 genome using CellRanger
(v3.0.2). Aligned cell/transcript counts were processed by Seurat (v3.2.0.9014
for initial in vitro cultures and v4.0 for subsequent xenografted cultures and
integration of xenograft data into in vitro data) to remove cells containing
fewer than 1000 genes, fewer than 1250 transcripts, or a high abundance of
mitochondrial reads (>7% total transcripts). Cells passing these thresholds
were then processed with Cellbender(v.0.1) in order to identify and remove
background reads and instances of barcode swapping. We then identified and
remove multiplets that arose during cell capture using Solo(v.0.1).
Additionally, xenograft libraries were aligned to a chimeric hg38/mm10 genome
using CellRanger (v.3.0.2) in order to identify potential cross-species
multiplets—cells identified as such were removed from analysis. Libraries were
integrated using Seurat’s SCTransform and FindIntegrationAnchors functions, to
identify integration features. First, in vitro cultured STICR experiments were
integrated together. Subsequently, transcriptomic libraries form xenograft
experiments were integrated with in vitro cells using integration anchors
identified from in vitro cultures. Cell clustering, pseudotime analysis, and
data visualizations (ie. UMAPs) were performed using Monocle3 (v0.2.1.9).
Pseudotime analysis of inhibitory neuron (IN) trajectory cells was performed by
setting the root node within mitotic IN clusters. IN.1, IN.2, and IN.3
trajectories were defined as major branches of the principal graph that led to
distinct sets of sets of clusters. Within subclustered IN cells, cluster 17
appeared to be at the beginning of both IN.2 and IN.3 trajectory cells in
pseudotime analysis and was thus termed “IN.early”.
