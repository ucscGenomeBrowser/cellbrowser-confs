<b>BACKGROUND:</b> The Human Cell Atlas is a large international collaborative
effort to map all cell types of the human body. Single-cell RNA sequencing can
generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays
between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and
difficulties in experimental design.
</p>
<p>
<b>RESULTS:</b> This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen,
esophagus, and lung from ≥ 5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality
single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome
sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable
resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison
of cell types. We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total
number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the
tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the
proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads,
and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples
in the spleen, which is cell type specific.
</p>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to
24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of
sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases
the time frames for sample processing.

Datasets in this collection were imported from the h5ad files available on the
<a href="https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/" target="_blank"> COVID-19 Cell Atlas website</a>
using the UCSC Cell Browser utility <code>cbImportScanpy</code>

<section>Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis</section>
<p>
Reads were mapped to GRCh38 1.2.0 Human Genome reference by Cell Ranger 2.0.2
pipeline. The EmptyDrops algorithm [41] was run on each sample. Identified
cells were used to generate the Cell Ranger filtered count matrix. An outlier
sample HCATisStabAug177276393 (spleen, Donor 302C, 24 h) in which fewer than
40% of reads were mapped to the transcriptome was removed from further analysis
(Additional file 1: Figure S3a). Count matrices were analyzed by the scanpy
version 1.4 [42] tool in Python version 3.7.2. Cells with less than 300 or more
than 5000 detected genes (8000 in esophagus), more than 20,000 UMI, and more
than 10% mitochondrial reads were removed. Genes that were detected in less
than three cells per tissue were removed. All donors and time points per tissue
were combined for analysis. The reads were log-transformed and normalized.
</p>

<section>Clustering and annotation of cell types</section>
<p>
To achieve good clustering by cell types, number of counts, mitochondrial
percentage, and donor effects were regressed out. PCA was carried out on highly
variable genes, and the donor effect was reduced by BBKNN tool [44]. Leiden
clustering [45] and UMAP visualization were performed for gaining clusters of
cells and visualization. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.5.0,
and plotting was in Python via scanpy or custom script and in R using ggplot2
version 2.2.1 or by using custom scripts. Cells which contained more than 10%
mitochondrial reads were assigned by similarity to their closest cell type
within a tissue with scmap tool [46], using cells with less than 10%
mitochondrial reads as a reference. The high and low mitochondrial percentage
cells were then combined for calculating the mitochondrial percentage per each
cell type. All code for the analysis is available at
https://github.com/elo073/TissStab.
</p>
<p>
Expression of known markers and re-analysis of bigger clusters were used to
annotate cell types, with cell markers shown in Additional file 1: Figure S9.
The major cell types were annotated for the lung, esophagus, and spleen by
looking at expression of known cell type markers. Three subsets from the lung
(mononuclear phagocytes and plasma cells; lymphocytes; dividing cells), two
subsets from the esophagus (immune; small clusters), and two subsets from the
spleen (DC, small clusters and dividing cells; CD4 and CD8 T cells) were
extracted, further analyzed by re-clustering, and annotated using known
markers. These updated annotations then replaced the original bigger ones.
