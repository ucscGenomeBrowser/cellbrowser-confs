The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is critical for metabolic
and immune functions. However, little is known about the cells that make up the
human liver and its immune microenvironment. Here we report a map of the
cellular landscape of the human liver using single-cell RNA sequencing. We
provide the transcriptional profiles of 8444 parenchymal and non-parenchymal
cells obtained from the fractionation of fresh hepatic tissue from five human
livers. Using gene expression patterns, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical
examinations, we identify 20 discrete cell populations of hepatocytes,
endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, B cells,
conventional and non-conventional T cells, NK-like cells, and distinct
intrahepatic monocyte/macrophage populations. Together, our study presents a
comprehensive view of the human liver at single-cell resolution that outlines
the characteristics of resident cells in the liver, and in particular provides
a map of the human hepatic immune microenvironment.

<section>10x sample processing and cDNA library preparation</section>
<p>
Samples were prepared as outlined by the 10x Genomics Single Cell 3′ v2 Reagent
Kit user guide. Briefly, the samples were washed twice in PBS (Life
Technologies) + 0.04% BSA (Sigma) and re-suspended in PBS + 0.04% BSA. Sample
viability was assessed via Trypan Blue (Thermo Fisher) and using a
haemocytometer (Thermo Fisher). Following counting, the appropriate volume for
each sample was calculated for a target capture of 6000 cells. Samples below
the required cell concentration as defined by the user guide (i.e., <400
cells/µl) were pelleted and re-suspended in a reduced volume and counted again
using a haemocytometer prior to loading onto the 10x Genomics single-cell-A
chip. After droplet generation, samples were transferred onto a pre-chilled
96-well plate (Eppendorf), heat-sealed and reverse transcription was performed
using a Veriti 96-well thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher). After the reverse
transcription, cDNA was recovered using Recovery Agent provided by 10x followed
by a Silane DynaBead clean-up (Thermo Fisher) as outlined in the user guide.
Purified cDNA was amplified for 12 cycles before being cleaned up using
SPRIselect beads (Beckman). Samples were diluted 4:1 (elution buffer
(Qiagen):cDNA) and run on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) to determine
cDNA concentration. cDNA libraries were prepared as outlined by the Single Cell
3′ Reagent Kits v2 user guide with appropriate modifications to the PCR cycles
based on the calculated cDNA concentration (as recommended by 10X Genomics).

<section>Cell clustering, differential expression, and pathway analysis</section>
<p>
Raw sequencing data (bcl files) were converted to fastq files with Illumina
bcl2fastq, version 2.19.1 and aligned to the human genome reference sequence
[http://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-1.2.0.tar.gz].
The CellRanger (10X Genomics) analysis pipeline was used to generate a digital
gene expression matrix from this data. The raw digital gene expression matrix
(UMI counts per gene per cell) was filtered, normalized, and clustered using R
[https://www.R-project.org/]. Cell and gene filtering was performed as follows:
Cells with a very small library size (<1500) and a very high (>0.5)
mitochondrial genome transcript ratio were removed. Genes detected (UMI
count > 0) in less than three cells were removed.
</p>

<p>
Normalization was performed in the scran R package using the default
implementation of their pool and deconvolute normalization algorithm84,85.
Briefly, this normalization method proceeds as follows: hierarchical clustering
using a distance metric derived from Spearman’s correlation is performed to
subset the data into more homogenous groups. Within each group, cell-wise
scaling factors are determined, and then normalization is performed between
groups. Scaling factors per cell were determined by pooling random subsets of
cells, summing their library sizes, and comparing to average library size
across all cells in the group. This is iteratively performed, and the cell-wise
scaling factors can be deconvolved from the set of pool-wise scaling factors.
This method is robust to the sparsity of the data and respects the assumption
of minimal differential gene expression common to most normalization methods.
</p>

<p>
After normalization, clustering is performed using standard Seurat package
procedures86. Briefly, principal component analysis was used to reduce the
number of dimensions representing each cell. The number of components used was
determined based on the elbow of a scree plot. A shared nearest neighbor graph
was built from distances computed in principal component space. A smart local
moving algorithm was used to identify communities in the graph. Selection of a
biologically relevant number of clusters was based on differential expression
between neighboring clusters. Differential expression between clusters was
calculated using a likelihood-ratio test for single-cell gene expression
implemented in Seurat at a family-wise error rate of 5%. Neighboring clusters
in principal component space were identified as the next-nearest cluster to
each cell after the cell’s assigned cluster. Clusters were visualized using
t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding of the principal components
(spectral t-SNE) as implemented in Seurat. Cell-cycle phases were predicted
using a function included in Seurat that scores each cell based on expression
of canonical marker genes for S and G2/M phases (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Data
7). The cell-type identities for each cluster were determined manually using a
compiled panel of available known hepatocyte/immune cell transcripts. Pathways
enriched in specific clusters in Figs. 5d, 8c and Supplementary Figs. 10, 12,
13 were elucidated via a pairwise analysis using the Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) software from the Broad Institute
(software.broadinstitute.org/GSEA)(version 3.0). Pathway enrichment analysis
examining active cellular pathways in hepatocyte clusters in Fig. 4d was
performed using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA)87 software from Bioconductor
(version 1.28). Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_November_01_2017_symbol.gmt
from [http://baderlab.org/GeneSets] was used to identify enriched cellular
pathways in GSVA and GSEA analysis. Highly related pathways were grouped into a
theme and labeled by AutoAnnotate (version 1.2) in Cytoscape (Version 3.6.1).
GSEA and GSVA results were visualized using the Enrichment Map app88 (Version
3.1) in Cytoscape (Version 3.6.1). R scripts for the data processes and all
GSEA raw data (Figs. 5d, 8c and Supplementary Figs. 10, 12, 13 found at:
