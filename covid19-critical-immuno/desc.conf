Dysfunctional immune response in the COVID-19 patients is a recurrent theme
impacting symptoms and mortality, yet the detailed understanding of pertinent
immune cells is not complete. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 284
samples from 205 COVID-19 patients and controls to create a comprehensive
immune landscape. Lymphopenia and active T and B cell responses were found to
coexist and associated with age, sex and their interactions with COVID-19.
Diverse epithelial and immune cell types were observed to be virus-positive and
showed dramatic transcriptomic changes. Elevation of ANXA1 and S100A9 in
virus-positive squamous epithelial cells may enable the initiation of
neutrophil and macrophage responses via the ANXA1-FPR1 and S100A8/9-TLR4 axes.
Systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, mainly by megakaryocytes and monocytes in
the peripheral blood, may contribute to the cytokine storms frequently observed
in severe patients. Our data provide a rich resource for understanding the
pathogenesis and designing effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.

<section>Single cell RNA library preparation and sequencing</section>
<p>
Cell suspensions were barcoded through the 10x Chromium Single Cell platform
using Chromium Single Cell 5’ Library, Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library, Gel
Bead and Multiplex Kit, and Chip Kit (10x Genomics). The loaded cell numbers
range from 300-500,000 aiming for 300-14,000 single cells per reaction.
Single-cell RNA libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ v2
Reagent (10x Genomics; PN-120237, PN-120236 and PN-120262), Chromium Single
Cell 3’ v3 Reagent (10x Genomics; PN-1000075, PN-1000073 and PN-120262) the
Chromium Single Cell 5’ v2 Reagent (10x Genomics, 120237), and Chromium Single
Cell V(D)J Reagent kits (10x Genomics, PN-1000006, PN-1000014, PN-1000020,
PN-1000005) was used to prepare single-cell RNA libraries according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Each sequencing library was generated with a
unique sample index. The libraries were sequenced using either DIPSEQ, BGISEQ
or Illumina platforms.

<section>Single-cell RNA-seq data processing</section>
<p>
Single-cell sequencing data were aligned and quantified using kallisto/bustools
(KB, v0.24.4) (Bray et al., 2016) against the GRCh38 human reference genome
downloaded from 10x Genomics official website. Preliminary counts were then
used for downstream analysis. Quality control was applied to cells based on
three metrics step by step: the total UMI counts, number of detected genes and
proportion of mitochondrial gene counts per cell. Specifically, cells with less
than 1000 UMI counts and 500 detected genes were filtered, as well as cells
with more than 10% mitochondrial gene counts. To remove potential doublets, for
PBMC samples, cells with UMI counts above 25,000 and detected genes above 5,000
are filtered out. For other tissues, cells with UMI counts above 70,000 and
detected genes above 7,500 are filtered out. Additionally, we applied Scrublet
(Wolock et al., 2019) to identify potential doublets. The doublet score for
each single cell and the threshold based on the bimodal distribution was
calculated using default parameters. The expected doublet rate was set to be
0.08, and cells predicted to be doublets or with doubletScore larger than 0.25
were filtered. After quality control, a total of 1,598,708 cells were remained.
We normalized the UMI counts with the deconvolution strategy implemented in the
R package scran (Lun et al., 2016). Specifically, cell-specific size factors
were computed by computeSumFactors function and further used to scale the
counts for each cell. Then the logarithmic normalized counts were used for the
downstream analysis.
