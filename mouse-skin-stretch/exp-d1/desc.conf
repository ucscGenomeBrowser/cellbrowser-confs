Sequencing reads were aligned and annotated with the mm10-1.2.0 reference
dataset as provided by 10X Genomics and demultiplexed using CellRanger
(v.2.1.1) with default parameters. Further downstream analyses were carried out
individually for each of the four samples (CTRL, EXP.D1, EXP.D4 and TPA).
Quality control was performed using the scater R package (v.1.10.0)58. For each
sample, all of the cells passed the following criteria: had more than 4,000 UMI
counts, showed expression of more than 1,500 unique genes and had less than 10%
UMI counts belonging to mitochondrial sequences. Read counts were normalized
using deconvoluted cell-specific size factors with the scran R package
(v.1.10.2)59. Cell-cycle phases were assigned using the cyclone function from
scran60. Dimensional reduction and clustering were performed using the Seurat R
package (v.3.1.1). A PCA for each sample was calculated using the scaled
expression data of the most variable genes (identified as outliers on a
mean/variability plot, implemented in the FindVariableGenes function from
Seurat). To remove unwanted sources of variability caused by differences in
cycling stages but retaining the distinction between cycling and non-cycling
cells, the differences between S-phase and GS/M-phase scores (determined by
cyclone) were regressed out during scaling (by setting the vars.to.regress
parameter of the ScaleData function in Seurat). UMAP61 calculation and
graph-based clustering were done for each sample using the appropriate
functions from Seurat (default parameters) with the respective PCA results as
input. Different values of the resolution parameter were tested for the
clustering. We set the final resolution to 0.6 (after testing a range from
0.3–1.2) first in the control sample, and then applied the same parameters to
the other samples. Given that the obtained clustering sensitivity for a given
resolution is dependent on the number of cells of that subpopulation in each
respective sample, we swept over the same range of resolutions for the other
samples, to assure the presence/absence of described clusters in all samples.
This resolution best reflected the biological heterogeneity that emerged from
the lineage tracing and the analysis of the clonal data, identifying a
progenitor population (characterized by intermediate levels of Krt5, Krt14,
Krt1 and Krt10) that emerged as an intermediate cluster between the stem cells
(that expressed high levels of Krt14, Krt15 and integrins) and the
differentiated population (highly enriched in Krt1 and Krt10). A Wilcoxon
rank-sum test was used to define marker genes for each cluster.
Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction for potential cluster marker genes across all
samples (n = 10,651) using the p.adjust method in R and only markers expressed
in at least 25% of cells of the cluster, having an average log-fold change of
at least 0.25 were reported. Differentially expressed genes and regulons
between the CTRL SCs and EXP D1 STRETCH SCs and SCs clusters were computed as
two-sided Wilcoxon ranked sum tests using the FindMarkers function in Seurat
and p-values were FDR adjusted for the total number of comparisons (n = 542 and
n = 571 respectively). Pseudotime ordering of cells was calculated using
slingshot (v.1.1.0)27. We checked the robustness of the resulting trajectories
by performing the analysis on PCA and UMAP reductions and also on downsampled
subsets of the data to half the dataset size, these different reductions and
permutations did not affect the described trajectories. Gene regulatory network
analysis was performed using SCENIC26 with default parameters. Differentially
activated regulons for each cluster were determined by performing a Wilcoxon
rank-sum test on the normalized regulon AUC values of cells in the various
clusters, p-values were FDR-adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg method and
regulons with an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 were considered differentially
activated. For visualization purposes we integrated the CTRL, EXP D1, EXP D2
and TPA samples using the Seurat package’s standard CCA-MNN based data
integration workflow. Feature selection was performed using the
FindVariableFeatures function fom Seurat with default parameters, selecting the
2,000 most variable genes. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) followed by
integration anchors selection was then performed on the selected features using
the FindIntegrationAnchors function from Seurat, taking the first 20 dimensions
from the CCA into account, as described by the Seurat authors62. These anchors
were then used to integrate the data with the IntegrateData function.

To compare the single-cell RNA-seq data from the treated EXP D2 samples (EXP
D2-Trametinib and EXP D2-MAL inhibitor), data integration was performed with
the EXP D1 sample following the approach implemented in Seurat62. The samples
with the treatments were sequenced at a different time point than the EXP D1
sample and had in general lower UMI count distributions. Therefore, the UMI
counts matrix of the EXP D1 sample was first downsampled, using the
downsampleMatrix function from the DropletUtils package
(https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DropletUtils.html), such
that its total number of counts was the same as the average of the total number
of counts of the treatment samples. QC filtering and pre-processing was then
performed as described before for each individual sample before integration.
Further downstream analyses such as dimensionality reduction and clustering
were all performed as described before using the integrated data. Cell-cycle
phase prediction and differential expression analysis were performed on the
uncorrected data to avoid interfering with the underlying distribution
assumptions of these statistical methods. Cluster annotation was mainly
performed by comparing the overlap of the new clusters of the integrated data
with the original cell type annotations of the EXP D1 sample and by studying
the expression of known marker genes. Differentially expressed genes and
regulons between the EXP D1 SCs and the EXP D2 SC clusters were computed as
two-sided Wilcoxon ranked sum tests using the FindMarkers function in Seurat
and p-values were FDR adjusted for the total number of comparisons (n = 13,786
and n = 758 respectively). Subpopulations that are not associated with the IFE
(infundibulum and sebaceous gland) were removed for the final analysis.
