<p>
The skin confers biophysical and immunological protection through a complex
cellular network established early in embryonic development. We profiled the
transcriptomes of more than 500,000 single cells from developing human fetal
skin, healthy adult skin, and adult skin with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
We leveraged these datasets to compare cell states across development,
homeostasis, and disease. Our analysis revealed an enrichment of innate immune
cells in skin during the first trimester and clonal expansion of
disease-associated lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. We uncovered
and validated in situ a reemergence of prenatal vascular endothelial cell and
macrophage cellular programs in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis lesional skin.
These data illustrate the dynamism of cutaneous immunity and provide
opportunities for targeting pathological developmental programs in inflammatory
skin diseases.

<section>Single cell RNA-seq</section>
<p>
For the droplet-encapsulation scRNA-seq experiments, we FACS sorted 7000 (for
3’ kit) or 10,000 (for 5’ kit) live, single cells and loaded them onto each
channel of the Single Cell chip (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) before
droplet encapsulation on the Chromium Controller. Sequencing libraries were
generated using the Single Cell 3’ or 5’ plus TCR enrichment reagent kits as
per the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were sequenced either using an
Illumina HiSeq 4000 using v4 SBS chemistry, or an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 to
achieve a minimum depth of 50,000 raw reads per cell.

<section>Alignment, quantification and quality control of scRNA-seq data</section>
<p>
Droplet-based (10x) sequencing data was quantified using the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software
Suite (version 3.1.0, 10x Genomics Inc) and aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome (official
Cell Ranger reference, version 3.0.0). Smart-seq2 sequencing data was aligned with STAR (version
2.5.1b), using the STAR index and aligned to the same GRCh38 reference genome. Gene-specific
read counts were calculated using htseq-count (version 0.10.0). Cells with fewer than 200 detected
genes and for which the total mitochondrial gene expression exceeded 20% were removed. Genes
that were expressed in fewer than 3 cells were also removed.

<section>Data embedding, visualization and clustering</section>
<p>
Principal components were calculated using scanpy.pca and adjusted for donor-to-donor variation
using the bbknn package (v1.3.2) (16) for batch correction. Dimensionality reduction and
embedding was performed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) by
the scanpy.tl.umap function. The resultant k-nearest neighbors graph was clustered using the
Leiden graph-based method (scanpy.tl.leiden)(87).

<section>Cluster annotation</section>
<p>
Differentially expressed genes were calculated using the Wilcoxon sum rank test restricted to
genes expressed in at least 30% of cells in either of the two populations compared, and with a fold
change cutoff of 0.25 (natural log scale). All p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the
Bonferroni correction. Initial annotation was ascribed by comparing these differentially expressed
genes to published bulk transcription profiles or protein expression of defined cell types. Following 
this, four major groups (lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, keratinocytes, and other non-immune cells)
were subset for further rounds of feature selection, embedding, visualization and clustering using
the same pipeline.
