There are currently limited Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs
and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19). Enhanced understanding of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis is critical for the
development of therapeutics. To provide insight into viral replication, cell
tropism, and host–viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell
(sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of experimentally infected human bronchial
epithelial cells (HBECs) in air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures over a time
course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted
ciliated cells as a major target at the onset of infection, which we confirmed
by electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Over the course of infection,
the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including
basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and
type III interferons (IFNs) and interleukin (IL)-6 but not IL-1. This results
in expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both infected and
bystander cells. This provides a detailed characterization of genes, cell
types, and cell state changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human
airway.

<section>Cell type annotation</section>
<p>
We used the standard scRNA-seq analysis pipeline for clustering [60]. Briefly,
to account for transcript dropout inherent to scRNA-seq, we removed genes that
were expressed in fewer than 3 cells and removed cells that expressed fewer
than 200 genes. Next, we filter out cells with more than 10% of mitochondrial
genes. We did not find a correlation between viral copy number and
mitochondrial expression. The resulting raw unique molecular identifier (UMI)
counts in each cell were normalized to their library size. Then, normalized
counts were square-root transformed, which is similar to a log transform but
does not require addition of a pseudo count. Data preprocessing was performed
in Python (version 3.7.4) using Scanpy (version 1.4.6) [61,62]. We visually
observed batch effects between conditions in 2D cellular embeddings. To remove
these batch effects for clustering, cell type annotation, and visualization, we
used an approximate batch-balanced kNN graph for manifold learning (BB-kNN
batch-effect correction) using Scanpy’s fast approximation implementation
[61,62]. BB-kNN assumes that at least some cell types are shared across batches
and that differences between batches for a same cell type are lower than
differences between cells of different types within a batch. For each cell, the
3 nearest neighboring cells in each condition were identified by Euclidean
distance in 100-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) space. This kNN
graph was used as the basis for downstream analysis. To visualize the scRNA-seq
data, we implemented various nonlinear dimension reduction methods and used the
BB-kNN batch-corrected connectivity matrix as input for UMAP [63] and Potential
of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding (PHATE) [64]. UMAP
projections were generated using a minimum distance of 0.5. PHATE projections
were generated with a gamma parameter of 1. For cell clustering, we used the
Louvain community detection method [65] with the BB-kNN graph. We used
high-resolution community detection and merged clusters based on expression of
bronchial epithelium cell-type markers in order to isolate some rare cell
types, e.g., tuft cells [66,67]. To annotate the different cell types present
in HBECs, we analyzed expressions of a range of marker genes that were reported
[67–77] and in a molecular cell atlas from Travaglini colleagues [66]. We
focused on 8 cell types: (i) basal cells (KRT5, DAPL1, and TP63); (ii) ciliated
cells (FOXJ1, CCDC153, CCDC113, MLF1, and LZTFL1); (iii) club cells (SCGB1A1,
KRT15, CYP2F2, LYPD2, and CBR2); (iv) BC/club (KRT4 and KRT13); (v)
neuroendocrine cells (CHG1 and ASCL1); (vi) Tuft cells (POU2F3, AVIL, GNAT3,
and TRPM5); (vi) ionocytes (FOXI1, CFTR, and ASCL3); and (viii) goblet cells
(MUC5AC, MUC5B, GP2, and SPDEF).
