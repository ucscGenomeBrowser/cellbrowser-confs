<p>
<b>Rationale:</b> Identification of the specific cell types expressing CFTR is
required for precision medicine therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF). However, a
full characterization of CFTR expression in normal human airway epithelia is
missing.

<p>
<b>Objectives:</b> To identify the cell types that contribute to CFTR
expression and function within the proximal-distal axis of the normal human
lung.

<p>
<b>Measurements and main results:</b> scRNA-seq identified secretory cells as
dominating CFTR expression in normal human large and particularly small airway
superficial epithelia, followed by basal cells. Ionocytes expressed the highest
CFTR levels but were rare, while expression in ciliated cells was infrequent
and low. scRNA-ISH, and scqRT-PCR confirmed the scRNA-seq findings. CF lungs
exhibited distributions of CFTR and ionocytes similar to normal controls.
CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion in culture tracked secretory cell, not ionocyte,
densities. Further, the nucleotide-purinergic regulatory system that controls
CFTR-mediated hydration was associated with secretory cells, and not ionocytes.
Lentiviral transduction of wild-type CFTR produced CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion
in CF airway secretory cells but not ciliated cells.

<p>
<b>Conclusions:</b> Secretory cells dominate CFTR expression and function in
human airway superficial epithelia. CFTR therapies may need to restore CFTR
function to multiple cell types, with a focus on secretory cells.

# methods: please describe roughly what the samples are and how you processed them computationally
methods = """
Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) was performed on freshly isolated human large
and small airway epithelial cells. Single cell-based RNA in situ hybridization
(scRNA-ISH) and quantitative RT-PCR (scqRT-PCR) were performed for validation.
In vitro culture systems correlated CFTR function to cell types. Lentiviruses
were used for cell-type specific transduction of wild-type CFTR in CF cells."""
