Although the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions
of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described
with bulk mixtures. Here we implemented a droplet-based, single-cell RNA-seq
method to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic
cells from four human donors and two mouse strains. Cells could be divided into
15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine
cell types, including rare epsilon-cells; exocrine cell types; vascular cells;
Schwann cells; quiescent and activated stellate cells; and four types of immune
cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression
profiles and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains.
Moreover, among human beta- cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation
of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER stress. Finally, we
deconvolved bulk gene expression samples using the single-cell data to detect
disease-associated differential expression. Our dataset provides a resource for
the discovery of novel cell type-specific transcription factors, signaling
receptors, and medically relevant genes.

<section>Single Cell Sequencing Bioinformatics Pipeline</section>
<p>
inDrop encapsulation of the cells and reverse transcription (RT) reaction was
carried out as previously reported (Klein et al., 2015). Library preparation
was carried out according to this protocol with the following minor changes:
random hexamers were used during the second reverse transcription step (after
linear amplification), eliminating the need for primer ligation. The number of
PCR cycles required for final library enrichment ranged from 9-12 cycles.
Paired end sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq 2500 machine. Reads
lacking any of the expected sequences in read 1 (known cell barcode, adaptor
sequence (W1), or beginning of the poly-T tail) were removed. Reads were
trimmed using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) (version 0.32) and split into
individual cells based on their match against both cell barcode sequences (BC1
and BC2, each with 384 unique possible sequences), with errors of up to two
nucleotides mismatch corrected. Read 2 was then mapped to the reference
transcriptome using bowtie (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) (version 1.1.1) and
expression was quantified as previously described (Klein et al., 2015) with the
added modification of ignoring reads containing a high fraction of single-base
repeats after quality trimming.
</p>

<section>Clustering</section>
<p>
Clustering was carried out recursively: for every subset of cells, only highly
expressed genes (fraction of total TPM above 0.5) and highly variant (Fano
factor above mean-dependent threshold) were used. Then, hierarchical clustering
was performed with Ward’s criterion over correlations computed from the
expression of the selected genes (log, TPM). This is carried out recursively,
until a subset of cells is 3 (or less), has only 3 high-variance genes (or
less) or has less than 2 genes enriched for that subset (75% of the TPMs).
Finally, we examine the clustering and search for cases which were over-split
(sample-specific effects, outliers of a few cells in a cluster) and assign them
to merged final clusters.
</p>

<section>Clustering Samples across Donors</section>
<p>
For each donor, we identified the most variable 2000 genes with at least three
counts in at least three cells. Variability was measured using the ν-score
noise statistic (Klein et al., 2015), which is closely related to the Fano
factor and measures above-Poisson noise. From these genes, we selected those
with the highest loading coefficients for each non-random principal component.
For each pair of cell types, we computed the cosine similarity among every
cell in the two groups to all other cells. These were summarized by an average
score for each cell. The similarity between the cell types is then estimated
as the average of these scores. Hierarchical clustering was used to order the
similarity matrix.
