methods = "Mice were treated with stimulants (G-CSF, poly(I:C), dmPGE2) for 2h and Prostaglandin in inhibitor indomethacin for 1 week. HSCs and MPPs were sorted from the same mice. The following markers define the subpopulations: HSC (lineage -, ckit+, Sca1+, CD48-, CD150+, CD34-), MPP1 (lineage -, ckit+, Sca1+, CD48-, CD150+, CD34+), MPP2 (lineage -, ckit+, Sca1+, CD48+, CD150+), MPP3/4 (lineage -, ckit+, Sca1+, CD48+, CD150-), MPP (lineage -, ckit+, Sca1+, CD48-, CD150-). After sorting MPP populations were labelled with HTO hashtag antibodies (https://cite-seq.com/cell-hashing/) for 30 minutes on ice. After washing MPP populations were pooled in equal ratios (also male and female cells) for 10x droplet formation. HSCs were processed in a separate 10x reaction. For computational analysis MPPs were first demultiplexed and then pooled at ratios according to the FACS sort. Clustering was performed using the Leiden algorithm (labelled as Louvain)"
