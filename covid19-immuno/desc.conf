In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the relationship between disease
severity and the host immune response is not fully understood. Here we
performed single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples of 5 healthy
donors and 13 patients with COVID-19, including moderate, severe and
convalescent cases. Through determining the transcriptional profiles of immune
cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor and B cell receptor sequences, we
analyzed the functional properties of immune cells. Most cell types in patients
with COVID-19 showed a strong interferon-α response and an overall acute
inflammatory response. Moreover, intensive expansion of highly cytotoxic
effector T cell subsets, such as CD4+ effector-GNLY (granulysin), CD8+
effector-GNLY and NKT CD160, was associated with convalescence in moderate
patients. In severe patients, the immune landscape featured a deranged
interferon response, profound immune exhaustion with skewed T cell receptor
repertoire and broad T cell expansion. These findings illustrate the dynamic
nature of immune responses during disease progression.

<section>Single cell RNA-seq data processing</section>
<p>
Raw gene expression matrices were generated for each sample by the Cell Ranger
(v.3.0.2) Pipeline coupled with human reference version GRCh38. The output
filtered gene expression matrices were analyzed by R software (v.3.5.3) with
the Seurat package (v.3.0.0). In brief, genes expressed at a proportion &gt;0.1%
of the data and cells with &gt;200 genes detected were selected for further
analyses. Low-quality cells were removed if they met the following criteria:
(1) &lt;800 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs); (2) &lt;500 genes; or (3) &gt;10% UMIs
derived from the mitochondrial genome. After removal of low-quality cells, gene
expression matrices were normalized by the NormalizeData function and 2,000
features with high cell-to-cell variation were calculated using the
FindVariableFeatures function. To reduce dimensionality of the datasets, the
RunPCA function was conducted with default parameters on linear-transformation
scaled data generated by the ScaleData function. Next, the ElbowPlot,
DimHeatmap and JackStrawPlot functions were used to identify the true
dimensionality of each dataset, as recommended by the Seurat developers.
Finally, we clustered cells using the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions
and performed nonlinear dimensional reduction with the RunUMAP function with
default settings. All details regarding the Seurat analyses performed in this
work can be found in the website tutorial
(https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.0/pbmc3k_tutorial.html).

<section>Multiple dataset integration</section>
<p>
To compare cell types and proportions across four conditions, we employed the
integration methods described at
https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.0/integration.html44. The Seurat package
(v.3.0.0) was used to assemble multiple distinct scRNA-seq datasets into an
integrated and unbatched dataset. In brief, we identified 2,000 features with
high cell-to-cell variation as described above. Second, we identified ‘anchors’
between individual datasets with the FindIntegrationAnchors function and
inputted these anchors into the IntegrateData function to create a
batch-corrected expression matrix of all cells, which allowed cells from
different datasets to be integrated and analyzed together.

<section>Subclustering of B cells and T cells</section>
<p>
B cells and plasma cells were extracted from PBMCs. Next, these major cell
types were integrated for further subclustering. After integration, genes were
scaled to unit variance. Scaling, principal component analysis and clustering
were performed as described above. Naive and activated T cells in PBMCs were
also extracted and subclustered using the procedure used for B cells.

<section>Cell-type annotation and cluster marker identification</section>
<p>
After nonlinear dimensional reduction and projection of all cells into
two-dimensional space by UMAP, cells were clustered together according to
common features. The FindAllMarkers function in Seurat was used to find markers
for each of the identified clusters. Clusters were then classified and
annotated based on expressions of canonical markers of particular cell types.
Clusters expressing two or more canonical cell-type markers were classified as
doublet cells and excluded from further analysis.
