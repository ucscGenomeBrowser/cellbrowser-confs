The hippocampus supports many facets of cognition, including learning, memory,
and emotional processing. Anatomically, the hippocampus runs along a
longitudinal axis, posterior-to-anterior in primates (corresponding to
dorsal-to-ventral in rodents). The structure, function, and connectivity of the
hippocampus vary along this axis.  In rodents, experiments have established the
cellular, molecular, and functional heterogeneity along the hippocampal axis,
resulting in comprehensive models of specialization that integrate these
different types of information.  In humans however, longitudinal functional
heterogeneity remains an active area of investigation, and structural
heterogeneity has not been described.  To better understand the cellular
composition and molecular diversity along the hippocampal long axis in the
human brain and define distinct molecular signatures corresponding to
functional domains we performed single-nuclei RNA-sequencing on surgically
resected human anterior and posterior hippocampus. Analysis of 129,908 nuclei
revealed differentially expressed genes between the anterior and posterior
human hippocampus at cellular resolution. We determine the program of these
axis- and cell-type specific genes that are conserved in the mouse hippocampus,
and we also identify patterns that are differential between the human and
mouse. We further identify axis- and cell-type specific gene expression
signatures that differentially intersect with human cognitive and
neuropsychiatric genetic signals, identifying cell type-specific genes in the
posterior hippocampus for cognitive function and in the anterior hippocampus
for mood and affect. Our data illuminate a region- and cell-type-specific
transcriptional landscape within the hippocampus.

<p>
Surgically resected hippocampus tissue (5 anterior, 5 posterior) was
homogenized using a glass dounce homogenizer in a nuclei lysis buffer. Debris
was removed with a density gradient centrifugation. Droplet-based single-nuclei
RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ v2 or v3
(#120237, 10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries
were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Reads were aligned to the
hg19-1.2.0 using using CellRanger software (v.3.0.2) (10x Genomics). Because
the nuclear transciptome contains unspliced transcripts, reads mapping to a
pre-mRNA reference file were counted. We used the R package Seurat (Stuart et
al., 2019) and custom scripts to preprocess the expression matrices. Cells with
>300 genes, <10000 UMIs, and <5% mitochondrial transcripts were retained for
downstream analysis. Genes located on the sex chromosomes and mitochondrial
genes were removed. Potential doublets were removed using DoubletFinder program
(McGinnis et al., 2019). Each sample was log normalized with a scale factor of
10,000 using NormalizeData, and 2000 variable genes were identified with
FindVariableGenes. Individual datasets were then combined using IntegrateData.
We scaled the integrated datasets by regressing for UMI number, percent
mitochondrial transcripts, batch, age, sex, epilepsy duration, and version of
10X chemistry.
