Cells bearing pigment have diverse roles and are often under strict
evolutionary selection. Here, we explore the regulation of pigmented cells in
the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, an emerging model for
diverse pigment function. We took advantage of single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq)
technology and discovered that pigment cells in the embryo segregated into two
distinct populations, a mitotic cluster and a post-mitotic cluster. Gcm is
essential for expression of several genes important for pigment function, but
is only transiently expressed in these cells. We discovered unique genes
expressed by pigment cells and test their expression with double fluorescence
in situ hybridization. These genes include new members of the fmo family that
are expressed selectively in pigment cells of the embryonic and in the coelomic
cells of the adult - both cell-types having immune functions. Overall, this
study identifies nodes of molecular intersection ripe for change by selective
evolutionary pressures.
