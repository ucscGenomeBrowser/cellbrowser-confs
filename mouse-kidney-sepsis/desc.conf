Sepsis is a dynamic state that progresses at variable rates and has
life-threatening consequences. Staging patients along the sepsis timeline
requires a thorough knowledge of the evolution of cellular and molecular events
at the tissue level. Here, we investigated the kidney, an organ central to the
pathophysiology of sepsis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing in a murine endotoxemia
model revealed the involvement of various cell populations to be temporally
organized and highly orchestrated. Endothelial and stromal cells were the first
responders. At later time points, epithelial cells upregulated immune-related
pathways while concomitantly downregulating physiological functions such as
solute homeostasis. Sixteen hours after endotoxin, there was global
call-cell communication failure and organ shutdown. Despite this apparent
organ paralysis, upstream regulatory analysis showed significant activity in
pathways involved in healing and recovery. This rigorous spatial and temporal
definition of murine endotoxemia will uncover precise biomarkers and targets
that can help stage and treat human sepsis.

<section>Experimental model and subject details</section>
<p>
Animal model: Male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.
Mice were 8-10 weeks of age and weighed 20-25 g. They were subjected to
a single dose of 5 mg/kg LPS tail vein injection E. coli serotype 0111:B4
Sigma. This dose of endotoxin carries no mortality and results in rapid
induction of cytokines/chemokines and causes reversible AKI as shown by serum
creatinine (Figure 7 - figure supplement 2). Animals were sacrificed at 0, 1,
4, 16, 27, 36, and 48 hr after LPS (both kidneys per animal for each time
point).
</p>
<section>Single cell library preparation</section>
<p>
The sample was targeted to 10,000 cell recovery and applied to a single cell
master mix with lysis buffer and reverse transcription reagents, following the
Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits V3 User Guide, CG000183 Rev A (10X
Genomics). This was followed by cDNA synthesis and library preparation. All
libraries were sequenced in Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform in paired-end mode
(28 bp + 91 bp). Fifty thousand reads per cell were generated and 91% of the
sequencing reads reached Q30 (99.9% base call accuracy). The total number of
recovered cells for all time points was 63,287 cells, and per experiment was
9191 (0 hr), 9460 (1 hr), 9865 (4 hr), 5165 (16 hr), 7678 (27 hr), 10,119 (36
hr), and 11,809 (48 hr after LPS).
</p>
<section>Single cell data processing</section>
<p>
The 10x Genomics Cellranger (v. 2.1.0) pipeline was utilized to demultiplex raw
base call files to FASTQ files and reads aligned to the mm10 murine genome
using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). Cellranger computational output was then
analyzed in R (v.3.5.0) using the Seurat package v. 3.0.1 (Stuart et al.,
2019). Seurat objects were created for non-integrated and integrated (inclusive
of all time points) using the following filtering metrics: gene counts were set
between 2000-3000 and mitochondrial gene percentages less than 50 to exclude
doublets and poor quality cells. Gene counts were log transformed and scaled to
10<sup>4</sup>. The top 20 principal components were used to perform unsupervised
clustering analysis, and visualized using UMAP dimensionality reduction
(resolution 1.0). Using the Seurat package, annotation and grouping of clusters
to cell type was performed manually by inspection of differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) for each cluster, based on canonical marker genes in the
literature (Kretzler and Ju, 2015; Lake et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2015; Park et
al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018). In some experiments, we used edgeR negative
binomial regression to model gene counts and performed differential gene
expression and pathway enrichment analyses (topKEGG, topGO, Figure 5, Figure
5 - figure supplement 1A, Figure 5 - figure supplement 2, and DAVID 6.8,
Figure 7B). (Alessandr√¨ et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2009).
</p>
<p>
The immune cell subset was derived from the filtered, integrated Seurat object.
UMAP resolution was set to 0.4, which yielded 14 clusters. The clusters were
manually assigned based on inspection of DEGs for each cluster, and cells
grouped if canonical markers were biologically redundant. We confirmed manual
labeling with an automated labeling program in R, SingleR (Aran et al., 2019).
