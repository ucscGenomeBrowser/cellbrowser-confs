This data set includes single-cell transcriptomes from multiple cortical areas
and the hippocampal formation, including 1,093,785 total cells. Samples were
collected from dissections of brain regions from ~8 week-old male and female
mice, from pan-neuronal transgenic lines.

Our goal is to define cell types in the adult mouse brain using large-scale
single-cell transcriptomics. Towards that goal, we have generated a dataset
that includes single-cell transcriptomes from multiple cortical areas and the
hippocampal formation. This dataset reveals the molecular architecture of the neocortex
and hippocampal formation, with a wide range of shared and unique cell types
across areas.

<p>
Samples were collected from dissections of brain regions
from ~8 week-old male and female mice, from a variety of transgenic lines. For
most brain regions, we isolated labeled cells from pan-GABAergic,
pan-glutamatergic, and pan-neuronal transgenic lines. For primary visual cortex
(VISp) and anterolateral motor cortex (ALM), we sampled additional cells using
driver lines that label more specific and rare types. To investigate the
correspondence between transcriptomic types and neuronal projection properties,
we collected cells labeled from retrograde injections for select combinations
of target injection sites and dissection regions. Labeled cells were collected
by fluorescence activated sorting (FACS) of single cells. We also collected
cells without fluorescent labeling to sample non-neuronal cell types. Isolated
single cells were processed for RNA sequencing using SMART-Seq v4 and 10x
Chromium v2.
