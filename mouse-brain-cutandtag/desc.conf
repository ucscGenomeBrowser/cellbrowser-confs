abstract = """
The development of the mouse central nervous system (CNS) involves coordinated
execution of transcriptional and epigenetic programs. These programs have been
extensively studied through single-cell technologies in a pursuit to
characterize the underlying cell heterogeneity. However, histone modifications
pose additional layers of both positive and negative regulation that defines
cellular identity. Here we show that the Cut&Tag technology can be coupled with
a droplet-based single cell library preparation platform to produce high
quality chromatin modifications data at a single cell resolution in tens of
thousands of cells. We apply single-cell Cut&Tag (scC&T) to probe histone
modifications characteristic of active promoters (H3K4me3), active promoters
and enhancers (H3K27ac), active gene bodies (H3K36me3) and inactive regions
(H3K27me3) and generate scC&T profiles for almost 50,000 cells. scC&T profiles
of each of these histone modifications were sufficient to determine cell
identity and deconvolute at single cell level regulatory principles such as
promoter bivalency, spreading of H3K4me3 and promoter-enhancer connectivity.
Moreover, we used scC&T to investigate the single-cell chromatin occupancy of
transcription factor Olig2 and the cohesin complex component Rad21. Our results
indicate that analysis of histone modifications and transcription factor
occupancy at a single cell resolution can provide unique insights of epigenomic
landscapes in the CNS.

<section>Single cell Cut&Tag</section>
<p>
Single cell Cut&Tag was performed as in Kaya-Okur et al. with modifications.
The Cut&Tag was performed in 0.5 ml tubes, all washes and incubation volumes
were 200 ul unless otherwise stated and all centrifugations were done using
swinging bucket centrifuge, with appropriate tube adaptors.
<p>
150,000 GFP+ or GFP-cells were sorted from the brain of Sox10::Cre/RCE animals
on post-natal day 15 (P15) or 21-25 (P21-P25) using fluorescent assisted cell
sorting (FACS Aria III or FACS Aria Fusion) directly into the Antibody buffer
(20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.05% Digitonin,
0.01 % NP-40, 1x Protease inhibitors, 1% BSA), centrifuged for 5 minutes @300 x
g force, washed 1x with the antibody buffer, resuspended in 200 ul antibody
buffer with 1:50 diluted primary antibody (Table 1) and incubated overnight
with slow rotation. Next day the nuclei were centrifuged 3 minutes @ 600 x g,
washed 1x with 200 ul of Dig-wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5
mM Spermidine, 0.05% Digitonin, 0.01 % NP-40, 1x Protease inhibitors, 1% BSA),
resuspended in 200 ul of Dig-wash buffer with 1:50 diluted secondary antibody
(Table 1) and incubated for 1h at room temperature with slow rotation. Then,
nuclei were centrifuged 3 minutes @ 600x g, washed three times with 200 ul of
Dig-wash buffer, resuspended in 200 ul of Dig-300 buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6,
300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.05% Digitonin, 0.01 % NP-40, 1x Protease
inhibitors, 1% BSA) with 1:100 diluted proteinA-Tn5 fusion and incubated for 1
hour rotating at room temperature. After Tn5 binding, the cells were
centrifuged 3 minutes @ 300 x g and washed 3x with Dig-300 buffer, resuspended
in 200 ul of tagmentation buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM
Spermidine, 0.05% Digitonin, 0.01 % NP-40, 1x Protease inhibitors, 10 mM
MgCl), without BSA and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After that, tagmentation
was stopped by addition of 10 ul of 500 mM EDTA and 200 ul of Dig-300 buffer
with BSA, and mixed by gently pipetting up and down several times (Final 0.5 %
BSA, critical, otherwise the nuclei would clump during the centrifugation).
Then the nuclei were centrifuged 3 minutes @ 300 x g, washed once with 1xPBS +
1% BSA and resuspended in 50 ul of 1x PBS+ 1% BSA before counting with counting
chamber with trypan blue staining. At this stage clumping of the nuclei can be
checked (with either trypan blue stain or DAPI) and if the sample is sufficient
quality, processed using 10x chromium single cell ATAC-seq kit, skipping the
Step 1 “Transposition” and continuing from Step 2.0 Generation & barcoding. We
used version 1 chemistry of single cell ATAC-seq kit (10x genomics) according
to the <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/4dXLdjCzh5xKBlgRBkfSmW/eb0b5b463ced5778fa68e7dc50829e50/CG000168_ChromiumSingleCell_ATAC_ReagentKits_UserGuide_RevD.pdf"

<section>Single cell Cut&Tag data processing</section>
<p>
Data was pre-processed using cell ranger-ATAC v1.2.0 (10x genomics), with
standard parameters. However, cell identification was done manually using
number of reads per cell and fraction of reads in peaks. Peaks were called
using MACS, single cell clustering and marker search was done using packages
Seurat and Signac, pseudotime analysis using slingshot, motif search using
MEME suite, and compared to the Jaspar database or published ChIP-seq data,
metagene plots using deepTools and custom scripts, most plots were generated
using ggplot2 R package, gene regulatory networks were analysed using ABC
model and cicero. Processing pipeline was build using Snakemake
platoform. Preprocessing pipeline and R notebooks used to generate the
figures are shared at
