Diverse cell types are produced from dorsal and ventral regions of the
developing neural tube. In this study we describe a system for generating human
inhibitory interneurons by ventralizing human embryonic stem cells in vitro and
characterizing the gene expression of the cell types produced over time. We
engineered a DCX-Citrine/Y hESC line to sort and characterize progenitor and
neuron transcriptomics separately at both the subpopulation and single cell
level. The cells generated in vitro were compared to similar populations
present in human fetal brain samples by mapping gene expression data from human
fetal cells onto the principal component analysis (PCA) space of in
vitro-derived populations. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
was used to determine the discreet cell types present at D24, D54, D100 and
D125 of culture, and describe the gene expression changes that occur in
progenitor and neuron populations over time. Immature lateral ganglionic
eminence and medial ganglionic eminence cells are present at early timepoints,
along with MGE-like and dorsal pallium-like neuronal progenitors. At later
timepoints we observe the emergence of SST-expressing interneurons, as well as
oligodendrocyte and astrocyte progenitors. We also identified genes that were
upregulated in somatostatin-expressing interneurons as they mature. The
transcriptomes of 1732 ventralized single cells were profiled by SmartSeq2 at
different timepoints throughout a 125-day differentiation protocol that
converted H1 human embryonic stem cells to a variety of ventrally-derived cell
types.
